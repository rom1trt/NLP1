Women in workforce; are we focusing right?,Liberal,2,nmvyhz,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/nmvyhz/women_in_workforce_are_we_focusing_right/,6,"I (M38) am a person of colour, working in Australia and face this everyday at work that most of bosses are white males, all their bosses are almost all of them white male. 

With that layed out I question why we have so much of media focus and energy on ""Women in workforce"". Are we fighting the right battle? 

Women are getting assaulted by trusted males in their lives, women are not safe on streets, women are facing challenges in everyday life. Should we not focus more on that. 

I am not saying there women in workforce is NOT an issue. It is an issue, so is people of colour in leadership, which is where I am stuck at. I am far more capable from a lot of people I work with but I won't get to leadership sooner than them. They have the network, they have more common grounds with people in leadership. They will build stronger alliances and grow faster. 

My argument is we, both women and people of colour came in late. This was an issue 10, 20, 50 years ago. White males had a headstart and hence they have formed this network and trust at the top leave. We are surely breaking into it fast. I truely believe that making women safe or avoiding racism outside work will have a snowball effect. 

I am eager to hear why I am wrong. Is my thinking isolated? In a bubble? I am happy to be wrong, just remember, hate speeches will not help. 

I will leave you with that thought!

 (6) An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or another form of psychological distress solely because of the individual's race or sex;

 (9) Promoting or advocating the violent overthrow of the United States government; **(Do these people have any self awareness?)**

 (10) Promoting division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people; or

(11) Ascribing character traits, values, moral or ethical codes, privileges, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of the individual's race or sex.

This amendment does not prohibit an LEA or public charter school from including, as part of a course of instruction or in a curriculum or instructional program, or from allowing teachers or other employees of the LEA or public charter school to use supplemental instructional materials that include:

(1) The history of an ethnic group, as described in textbooks and instructional materials adopted in accordance with present law concerning textbooks and instructional materials;

(4) Historical documents that are permitted under present law, such as the national motto, the national anthem, the state and federal constitutions, state and federal laws, and supreme court decisions.

"Flipped Script: An experiment in telling men to smile the same way they often tell women to, as if they were entitled to smiling women",Liberal,215,n92ztc,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/n92ztc/flipped_script_an_experiment_in_telling_men_to/,23,"I hope this is not in violation of the rules. 

So when I saw a post last week about a woman sick of being told to smile, it inspired me.  I've seen the type of complaint before, but this one made me realize exactly how pernicious it was.  I decided to try it on men, and especially those who told a woman too. The results were amusing, and a couple of stories worth telling so I thought I would share.

I'm a 41 year old overweight male, which I feel is important for the context of the reactions I got.  I consider myself feminist, and read several women's subreddits so i can better understand issues i am not directly affected by, because i can better speak out when i see issues when i am more aware of them.  

First, I counted a total of 104 men I told to smile. Of those

23 ignored me completely

31 Actually smiled (plus 4 who laughed)

18 gave me strange looks but otherwise did not react

29 got varying degrees of offended (16 of whom called me gay)

2 threatened me with violence

1 threatened me with sexual harassment

Of special note, those who I told to smile after they told a woman to were FAR more likely to fall into the offended category than the actual smile category. Be aware none of these men did I react instantly to tell them to smile, but waited a few minutes to let their incident be ""cold"".

Three stories are really worth sharing.

The first happened on day 2 of the experiment. As part of one of my cases was a zoom call with a judge and the opposing council. Before the session was called, the opposing lawyer told my client they should smile instead of scowl (she wasn't scowling, she was just waiting nervously). She ignored him and I said nothing as the court was called into session. During the first recess, at the end as we were returning but before it was called back into session, I told him ""You should smile more when you talk, you are more handsome that way"". He went purple and told me it was ""wildly inappropriate to talk to him like that"". I asked him why he thought it was ok for him to speak to my client that way then. The judge said nothing, but she did chuckle before starting the session. I'm certain she has had her share of the problem too.

Second story was the threat of sexual harassment. This was in a grocery store. The man told the clerk she needed to smile as she started ringing him up. I waited till she was done, and as he was gathering the last of his bags, I told him his face would be more attractive if he smiled. He got MAD. And threatened to sue me for ""sexual harassment"". I pointed out that since we had no work relationship, he couldn't, but what he did to the young woman WAS harassment. He yelled again (wish i had written down what) then left before the scene got any further.

The last story worth telling was the good one with a better ending. This time a contractor doing some work in the building, told one of our aides the smile. So later that day, made an excuse to pass by where he was working and told him to smile. His first reaction was to be offended. But then he actually caught himself and said ""wait, is this because i said it to the girl earlier"". I nodded, and that was the end of it. Now I don't know if the question to him was a moment of self awareness about how uncomfortable it was, or just thinking I was getting revenge and he brushed it off, but I'd like to think the former? Maybe?

Anyway, I don't really have a point just thought I'd share this hoping you all found it as amusing as I did.

I wish i had kept better numbers how many of these were after they told a woman to smile, vs just told to smile and exact numbers on the difference.",1620648835.0

Interesting debate on beauty and confidence,Liberal,2,n7asnz,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/n7asnz/interesting_debate_on_beauty_and_confidence/,4,My roommate yesterday said that he hypothesized that the more beautiful you are the more confident you are. His supporting argument was that it’s because if you are beautiful you will have more opportunities and therefor will be more confident. I wholly disagree with this opinion. Sure... I  think that there could be a hint of truth to it but I noted that I think when women are told that they are beautiful all the time it reinforces that that’s all that matters and then makes you more scrutinizing on your own beauty. I also wonder if it’s different for men and women. Wondering what everyone thinks!,1620426511.0

My Progressive Diatribe,Liberal,80,n3mk0h,progressive,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/n3mk0h/my_progressive_diatribe/,37,"Just a US citizen who has an armchair opinion about how a progressive society should be:

- Cut military budget in half. Currently (per Google) at $721.5b.
- Use part of that cost reduction to finance putting a social worker with every police officer. 
- Ban private prisons, flat. 
- Legalize drugs and prostitution, placing heavy regulation/taxation on both. 
- End Citizen’s United. 
- Pathway to citizenship, focus on transparency and timeliness. 
- Universal childcare/preschool. 
- Universal community college. 
- 100% tax break for businesses that fund employee higher education reimbursement (BA/BS and above).
- Trimester-based P-CC education, end summer gap. 
- Universal healthcare. 
- Universal senior care (visiting nurses, retirement homes, hospice).
- Pass death with dignity. 
- Increase government funding of science research to support ecological and environmental science. 
- Heavily regulate lobbying, removing private funding and introducing transparency requirements for all spending (no private equity). 
- End gerrymandering. 
- Election holiday. 
- And fuck it, Universal Basic Income.

You give me all of that, I give you a utopian society capable of unimaginable progressive achievement and societal balance. Who wouldn’t want to live in a society like that?

Anyone could open a small business overnight, minimal cost to start (no retirement, no healthcare, no unemployment). Everyone would move to a contract-based employment schema since workers would always have a safety net/minimal income to fall back on, with UHC and free education to support career change or illness. People would absolutely still strive to work, for additional income/status. Those who couldn’t would have basic needs covered - homelessness gone. 

Everyone would develop a lifelong learning skill set with free skill-based education. Businesses would absolutely encourage additional higher education with tax break incentives. With universal childcare and preschool kids would have continuous learning available for their entire lives, fueling innovation and employment supply for commerce. 

The cost of all that big government would be covered by a steady supply of healthy, highly educated and emotionally supported workers paying income taxes and businesses paying appropriately for their staff balanced by the cost savings of entitlements they now don’t have to pay for. 

Sounds good to me.",1620011347.0

Polarization drives us apart in so many areas and our filter bubbles (on social media e.g.) keep us from learning about other political groups and why they think differently. Do you view a problem about that as well?

How Progressive Policies Can Bring Rural Voters Back Into the Fold,Liberal,1,mwa24g,progressive,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/mwa24g/how_progressive_policies_can_bring_rural_voters/,0,"Democrats are seeing gains across the board in many cases, but rural America, once a stronghold for Democrats in many parts of the country, is turning a deep red. Progressive Democrat Erica Smith has already won several state-level elections in a rural district that represents a mix of conservative liberal counties. Several counties in her district went for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and for Trump in 2016. She hopes to be a trailblazer in the Democratic field, to prove how progressive policies can appeal to conservative people. 

People respond when their needs are being met, and when they are being heard. Facts and data are a bipartisan language that can improve people’s lives. The number of Americans without access to high speed broadband internet is so nebulous nobody has a concrete number, it’s anywhere from 21 to 42 million people, according to government and independent sources. Broadband was important before, and a necessity in a post-COVID world. 

17.5% of America’s rural areas have a population aged 65 or older, compared to the average of 13.5% in urban areas. These are some of America’s most vulnerable people, yet we see unprecedented rates of rural hospitals closing. America’s elderly deserve better, and while we understand that it is becoming more difficult to run a profitable rural hospital, healthcare is a human right and the government should step in and fill the gap. (We support Medicare for All in general, but that’s another post!). 

Policy is our love language here at Team Erica HQ, and we believe that a data-based push can bring many rural voters to our side in 2022 and beyond.",1619112748.0

Hello (M17), I am from Tigray which is where the Genocide is happening right now in Africa. This should be every humans issue but people are so divided these days I have to go around and request help from different communities. Women in Tigray are being raped. I have personally received a video of a raped Tigrayan woman in surgery and they removed nails and other foreign objects that were shoved in her uterus by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. [**HERE**](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2C20P0) is an article about it.

I have heard a lot of disgusting stories. But I have never seen anything like this. More than 200 are rape victims in one barely functioning hospital which was looted and only 5 of them have come forward in fear of stigma. Around 150 of them have contracted HIV which was the goal of the Ethiopian government. Now most of these women are going to die while giving birth or another horrible scenario. Those kids are going to grow up orphaned, HIV positive and probably starving if this madness doesn't stop. I have lost 2 of my uncles. I am not saying this to seek sympathy but to shed light on the Genocide that's happening.

I found out one of my uncles was dead on Facebook where there was this picture of his bloodied dead body and his best friends also dead surrounded by Ethiopian soldiers laughing at them and I didn't tell my mom what I saw to let her find out in a different way and she did. And anyone who has a loving mother knows what it feels like to see your mother grief, filled with pain. Now imagine the grief of those mothers that are literally seeing there sons being shot in the head or even worse getting beaten to death in order not to waste bullets.

**WARNING GRAPHIC SHORT STORY AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Eritreans and Ethiopian soldiers entered a house and wanted to rape this girl. Her brother said ""I would not let you rape my sister"" and they straight up shot him in the head with no remorse. And they raped her right there in front of her brothers bleeding lifeless body. She is the one that told this story.

Another one is ""Eritreans and/or Ethiopian soldiers entered a house where there was this preacher. They told him to rape his daughter or watch her get raped by them. I will not share the results of that situation as it is toooooo disturbing .

The women are suffering the most here. They rape and humiliate those women. Please donate what ever extra thing you have and if you don't, no worries just spread awareness about it.

**Click** [**HERE**](https://omnatigray.org/) **for a website dedicated to the Tigray Genocide so that you can learn more about it and get more info.**

Thank you for your support whether it is an upvote or sharing it with your friends and families .

And if you want picture and videos to see the brutality that's happening which I do not recommend, DM me. But I will not share the video of the women in surgery whose gentiles are shown for her mental health in the future.

And here are 2 articles from CNN (FREE) and The New York times that can explain the tip of the iceberg better and are far more credible than a random reddit user

I thought it was going to be a fun gory punks vs nazis film. It was not. I immediately regretted watching it because it was too real to me, as in the band members in the movie were way too close to my sister's friends growing up and the scenario was way too realistic and likely to happen. I'm bad with horror films but usually the fear is contained to jumping at shadows and minor stuff for a night and then I get over it. I wanted to buy a gun after watching The Green Room. It stayed at the back of my mind for like two weeks. Because those assholes are out there. Atomwaffen, Christian Identitarians, and just several brands of fascists that do want to hurt you and your friends.

So, I started thinking about it and read up on history of historical instances of antifascist punks like the SkinHeads Against Racist PunkS or the SHARPS that would fight against fascist ""punks"" at shows. Also the fact that the song ""Nazi Punks, Fuck Off"" was made by The Dead Kennedys to tell their growing nazi fans to go away. Now technically, these are not really Communist groups. They're anarcho-something at best. 

But there's a sort of message there that I wanted to see if anyone else believed in and who better to understand agitprop than this subreddit. Could The Green Room be considered (unintentional) Agitprop?",1618685789.0

I have added a new episode of my podcast Female Form Podcast. This one is about the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar and the history of her worship. She is the oldest female deity about whom written evidence exists and one of the great symbols of modern feminism. Ancient people worshipped her as the goddess of love and sexuality, fertility, war and warfare, prophecy, and justice. At the same time, she was the personification of Planet Venus, The Morning and Evening Star. As such, we know now that she affected other, later religions and we know her now in many different forms.

I hope it will interest you! I would be always thankful for your comments and feedback! <3

You can listen on Spotify, Apple Podcast, stitcher and other podcasting apps.

Hope you will enjoy it!",1618328036.0

The Cheating Wife/Woman and how her story sometimes tragically ends (in fiction and reality),Liberal,26,mff02f,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/mff02f/the_cheating_wifewoman_and_how_her_story/,27,"Cheating has been going on since, well as long as humans have been around basically. Desire is a part of us and we often act on it. Sex is one of our primary and greatest desires (unless you're asexual and nothing bad about that, just to make it clear). In relationships we know people sometimes desire others when they're already with someone. Sometimes they pursue the other person/people and sometimes they don't. Sometimes it remains a secret and other times it doesn't...but...what happens...when the secret is revealed...bad things may happen.

Now men cheat too, it happens and they do get confronted too, sometimes attacked (which isn't great either). I'm not saying it isn't understandable why someone would get mad at learning someone they're with had cheated. But what some do once they've learned the truth...is horrifying.

Now, it seems that in fiction, there's a difference in how often a cheating man is presented in contrast to a cheating woman. In one film (which I can't remember and didn't watch), but a man who had a wheelchair-bound wife as a result of an accident they were in (and she blames him for while taking her anger out on him while seeking some kind of miracle cure) and he has an affair with a woman (who is also married) yet it's supposed to represent a means of sympathy for him. That his affair is understandable and that he isn't bad for what he does. (There's also the matter of his wife being found dead and him being suspected of it, but I didn't watch the film so I don't know what happened.) This isn't to say how it's always presented, but it speaks as to how the cheating man is portrayed.

However, in the 1995 film Above Suspicion, a woman cheats on her paralyzed husband...and...I don't know what happened to her and her lover...but I saw some horrifying comments online that they 'deserved what happened'...and I know her husband planned their murder from the hypnosis...and I think he got away with it (didn't watch the movie). But it's framed in more than one 'colorful' way by people that she deserved what happened to her because she was cheating on him. We see women humiliated, degraded, beaten...and murdered because they cheated on a man. Women will be threatened with guns...or gunned down by men once they learned of the affairs.

In our world, there are men who have murdered their wives, fiancés, and girlfriends for learning they cheated on them. The women's deaths have been all kinds of horrifying and cruel. And fiction reflects this. Women die usually cruel deaths at the hands of men for being in affairs and people will say they deserved it, that they were glad it happened. Some say it should be expected if cheating happens. One guy on a site said he'd be glad to find out his wife was cheating so he could, as he said, decapitate her. And there are...stories where women have met such fates for cheating.

I know cheating is a sore spot for people and it garners heated attitudes from some. Some despise it no matter what, some perhaps aren't judgmental, but the 'popular' perspective is contempt. (I have never been in a relationship or been with anyone, but I find it complicated...and I certainly don't believe someone should be killed for being in/having an affair. As a guy, I don't know if this means more or less for what I'm saying. Maybe this is a statement coming from privilege...I don't know...but I felt regardless, it's something that should be said.)

Yes, men have died for being involved in affairs and this is also terrible. When we look at it, it's often the men a woman is cheating with (as in the movie I said and in other fiction, such as the movie Shooting the Warwicks where a cheating wife and the man she slept are murdered by her husband...and in several crime shows the same thing happens). Yet we also see where the women men cheat with are killed, but not the man at the hands of the/because of the wife as a way to 'punish' the cheating man. The women die, but he lives. We really don't, or don't usually, see this in the opposite case. The cheating woman and man die, or just the cheating wife.

Just...the women dying...for just embracing/acting on desires...is terrible...and it's cruel that men can/do get away with it. A few decades ago in Kentucky, a man learned his wife was sleeping with a Senator's son and murdered them both, but got away scot free because it was 'a matter of honor'. Men have murdered cheating women for millennia and gotten away with it, hell, they're often celebrated/uplifted for 'giving the woman what she deserved'.

No one should die for being involved in/having an affair. If someone thinks they should/tries to kill that person for cheating, they deserve to be cheated on. (A controversial opinion/perspective, I admit...but the suffering of women is often some of the worst when she acts on her desires...and society applauds when she gets her 'just desserts'.)

(I'm sorry for the rant...but...I keep coming across these stories, both in reality and in fiction...and I couldn't keep not saying something. Such stories replay in my mind constantly, and my heart breaks, my blood boils...and I cry...I know this may flair tempers and some may call me insane for this...but...women shouldn't die for being involved in affairs...)",1616982119.0

When people who are rightfully angry at incels say to them “just get laid” they are reinforcing the same patriarchal ideas which oppress women, by encouraging men to view sexual promiscuity as an important achievement which should be prioritized above all other forms of meaningful self-development and education on sex/gender issues and general consideration toward other people’s perspectives.

Men and violent crimes,Liberal,1,m7mbhw,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/m7mbhw/men_and_violent_crimes/,4,"When it comes to violent crime and gender there is one fact that sticks out. Men commit violent crimes at a higher rate than women. But why is that? Some would tell you that men are just more prone to violence than women, however I believe this idea is wrong. Men don’t desire to commit crimes more than women, they're just more capable of committing them.

    For this argument an analogy is required. Let’s say there is an apple tree. The vast majority of people walk past the tree with no desire to pick the apples from the tree because they know the apple tree does not belong to them. Now an individual walks by the apple tree and stops. They look up at the apples growing on the tree and thinks to themselves “I want one of those apples.” however this person is 5 '4 they can’t reach the apples. Knowing this the individual walks away without the apple. Sometime later a second individual walks by the apple tree and like the last person they want an apple, but unlike the last person this individual is 6 ‘4 they can reach the apples. So they reach up and grab an apple. Both individuals had the desire to commit an act they knew was wrong, but only one of them was capable of going through with it. In the real world the 5 ‘4 individual would be a woman while the 6 ‘4 individual would be a man. 

    When it comes to violent crimes like assault, rape, and murder the desire to commit isn’t all you need, you also need the ability to commit. And since the victims of these crimes are mostly male with 76% of homicide victims being men. A perpetrator would have to be capable of overpowering the average man a task women are just not able to do. Women are held back by their morals and their physical capabilities while men are only held back by morals.

           So despite what the data would suggest men aren’t more likely to abandon their morals. It’s just that there is a small percentage of people who lack morals and within this group the men are the ones capable of following through on their impulses.",1616056023.0

Please consider liking because those who possess some backwards views definitely don't hesitate from disliking!

What I don’t understand is why we don’t force those old conservative bastards to actually get up there and do the filibuster and show America how little they care about issues that impact Americans? I would think the American people might get tired of seeing them block progress reading the paper out loud or whatever for hours on end. Meanwhile punish those Republicans by making them stand all those hours without being able to change their depends. I’m tired of seeing Dems back away scared.

We can’t keep doing this. There’s a simple solution to fixing American society.,Liberal,7,lu38fc,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/lu38fc/we_cant_keep_doing_this_theres_a_simple_solution/,1,"I think we can all pretty much all agree that there are some serious problems with American society, and that we have been on a steady trajectory of ignoring them and/or making them worse. The fact that we have been moving in the wrong direction for so long comes with a certain momentum that limits the range of possible futures we might encounter. At this point, the bullseye of what we can expect is pointing somewhere in the cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic genre. With utopian futurism somewhere off the edge of the dartboard, if it’s still even within the range of possibilities.

So, I would strongly suggest that what is needed now is radical change. However, I would prefer it not be violent revolution, because aside from that being horrific, it would likely make the situation worse before it gets better, and likely just delay solutions to what needs solving.

When I stay up at night wondering what will be the ultimate fate of this society, there is only one outcome that gives me hope. A populous uprising, through democratic means, that forces our government to change into one that benefits the common people over the interest of the elites. 

The thing we are fighting, the source of all of these problems, is corruption, primarily that which has captured the two major governing parties. How well we solve this problem today will dictate how well all of the other problems rampant in our society are allowed to be fixed tomorrow.

I am working locally to institute new legislation to reform our elections, which will allow for new parties to replace the current establishment, or at least threaten them into action. However, the two-parties are largely united against this reform since it undermines their base of support. So, I have dreamt up an idea for a movement to force that change to occur faster.

It’s called Split Your Vote. It’s a bipartisan movement for people who are dissatisfied by their representation under the two-party system and want to support the growth of alternative options. Right now, support for both parties is at an all-time low, yet people are forced to support them because they see the other party as a worse alternative, so are trapped into voting for the lessor of two evils. 

I’m encouraging people to pair up with trusted friends or family who are going to be voting opposite them and see if they can come to an agreement to both support third-party candidates instead. Since their votes would have cancelled out anyway, this is a way of supporting alternatives without the worry of throwing off the ratio of the two-party race. I’m hoping to generate some momentum for a mass migration of people withdrawing their support from the two-party establishment.

You can read more at [www.splityourvote.com](http://www.splityourvote.com/). If you want to help you can read through the site about how to take the pledge to join. I also just set up a subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/) if you want to assist promoting the movement.

TLDR: Society is broken because of corruption in the two major political parties, so let’s try and replace them both by triggering a mass migration away from the current establishment. The mythology of which will be people pairing up across the aisle and voting third-party, since then their votes would have cancelled out anyway, they don’t have to worry about throwing off the results of the two-party race.",1614479276.0
This is the text of an email I just sent to Stacy Abrams of FairFight.,Liberal,3,lu17t0,progressive,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/lu17t0/this_is_the_text_of_an_email_i_just_sent_to_stacy/,0,"Stacey Abrams
FairFight.com

Dear Ms Abrams,

First, let me say how much I admire your work. FairFight has accomplished so much for all of us. As a voting rights activist since 1987, I understand that protecting our right to vote requires constant vigilance and action.

""Voter suppression"" summarizes everything we are against in a snappy, two-word phrase that everybody understands at once. But we need an equally pithy way to describe what we are FOR - a motto, a rallying cry, something that will fit on a sign.

I suggest ""voter encouragement.""

As a social worker, one of my first jobs at the Center for Independent Living of North Florida was to work with our local Supervisors of Elections to train the volunteers to understand that voting rights for persons with disabilities requires flexibility and good faith, as well as ballots in braille, cards for communicating with deaf people, ramps and wide doorways and so on. So many people with disabilities had been discouraged from voting, especially by well-meaning people who's only solution to every problem was ""Use a mail-in ballot!"". 

What is voter encouragement? Ten days of ten-hour early voting. Transportation to the polls. Ballots in the necessary languages. Voter registration at the DMV. Strict enforcement of the laws banning voter intimidation in all forms, from anonymous threatening phone calls to crowds of angry people blocking the polls. You know the methods of voter encouragement better than I do.

We could say that we're for ""Voter Participation"" or ""Universal Voting"", but to my ears those phrases sound dull and lifeless. ""Voter Encouragement"" is upbeat and lively. Words matter, and powerful words matter most.

Thank you for all you have done, and for taking the time to read this.

Taking a knee,Liberal,5,lu11zz,progressive,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/lu11zz/taking_a_knee/,0,"My thoughts are that when an athlete takes a knee, one party interprets it as 'they hate America, they hate our soldiers, they hate our flag and they are traitors to our nation'.

That is far from the truth.  Taking a knee is simply meant to silently and peacefully bring attention to apparent widespread systemic racism by the police.  

Soon that message morphed to police brutality in general against all races.  Hundreds of thousands of people of all colors worldwide agreed and took to the streets to peacefully show their support.

It was a [military veteran](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53098516) who suggested to Colin Kaepernick that taking a knee, instead of merely sitting on the bench, would be a simple, innocent gesture to use to garner more attention to his cause to raise awareness about police brutality.  

Simple and innocent - yes, but red hats politicized it and told their cult it was hate speech.  And, of course being a mindless, obedient maga red hat cult, they started hating the people who want less police brutality like they were told.  

So, using the associative property in math, if you disagree with the athletes taking a knee against police brutality - that means you agree with and want more police brutality.  

And that exact scenario played out in many cities across America in the summer of 2020.  People peacefully demonstrated against police brutality and to silence them they were brutalized by the police and military forces sent by trump**.

Shocking, right?  An entire political party rallying for more police brutality.  Hard to believe, but welcome to America under trump** rule...

As an aside, I saw trump** political ads during his reelection campaign that showed riots and violence with the headline **THIS WILL BE AMERICA UNDER BIDEN!!**, when the photos were taken in America under the trump** regime.  

That should be in the dictionary under the definition of irony...

Athletes who take a knee love America, and found a peaceful, silent way to protest and bring attention to a problem that needs national attention, without disrupting society.  

Perhaps if while taking a knee, singing along to the National Anthem with hand over heart will dispel the accusations of hatred for America and our troops and show their love for America and her traditions.  

Maybe they can take a knee while also waving a small American flag so the 'we love America but police brutality needs to be addressed' message gets out there!! 

Soon after these silent protests, the world watched (within days of each other) a police officer callously smirk at the camera while he outright murdered a black man with his knee on his neck for 9 minutes, watched 2 men in a pickup truck murder a black man jogging in a neighborhood where they thought he didn't belong and read about a sleeping black woman awoke and murdered by plainclothes police, who broke in, guns drawn, during a no knock warrant at the wrong house.

That's when the shit hit the fan and blacks, whites, browns, yellows, pinks and all colors took to the streets to protest *all police brutality* under the banner Black Lives Matter.  It became apparent that one political party fought back with the message *BLACK LIVES DO NOT MATTER*.  Sad

All three of those incidents played out over the course of a few days.  Similar incidents happen every day but don't get the worldwide press.

Ironic that so many peaceful demonstrations against police brutality were met by even more violent police brutality.  Once police and federal forces got violent trying to break up those mostly peaceful demonstrations, the demonstrators fought back.

To complicate the reporting of the protests, the DOJ, FBI and local authorities identified many of the arrested rioters as proud boys, oath keepers, boogaloo bois, evropa (I had to [google evropa when the DOJ and FBI brought them up](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=evropa&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) - wow), Q, 3 percenters and other trump** [red hat militias](https://i.imgur.com/Vp9etje.jpg).

I wish I still had the link, but many mayors & governors, including Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond, Virginia identified the rioters as white supremacists marching under the banner of Black Lives Matter, to implicate them in the violence.  Granted, many BLM protestors fought back, but the extreme right and the trump** police/militia armed for war played a major role in the violence that ensued.  

Very early in the protests the media showed a masked man dressed in black holding a black umbrella (it wasn't raining) breaking windows to incite a crowd to riot.  Investigations revealed he was a detective and the umbrella was a signal to police to leave him alone.

Something that really stuck with me was watching a vigil by many violin players gathered to pay tribute to Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black violinist and massage therapist from Aurora, Colorado, who died after being placed in a chokehold by police and being sedated by paramedics.  

During lunch breaks, he brought his instruments to animal shelters and played for the abandoned animals, believing that music put them at ease.  Many violin players played together in a park to honor his memory and support bringing attention to police brutality..

The video showed people, many sitting and swaying and just listening to music, when all of a sudden police armed for war came in violently, without being provoked, to brutally break up the vigil with tear gas, rubber bullets and batons.  

American citizens were silently sitting listening to music when the trump** mercenaries crushed them.... 

Today everyone has a video camera in their pocket, and the massive, daily documentation of police brutality, of every color, has received the attention needed to show the seriousness of police brutality in even the simplest interactions with the public.  

This has led to a justified distrust and even hatred of police and the federal troops trump** and his government send in to violently disperse any crowds, no matter how peaceful and are merely exercising their Constitutional right to assembly.

Many believe the cherry on top of this horrendous chapter in American history was when trump** ordered his military troops and police force to violently break up a peaceful demonstration with tear gas and rubber bullets and batons in Lafayette Square park in front of St John's Church across from the White House.  

Once a path was cleared, trump** walked to the church he has never attended [surrounded by his military guard](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/la-attorney-resists-the-call-to-reopen-courts-amid-covid-19/trump-response-protests/@@images/rectangular_image/page-header?v=1591135700.32)  to [hold up a Bible (upside down)](https://www.ncronline.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_width/public/20200602T0722-264-CNS-USA-PROTEST.jpg?itok=GnnbbQWM) which he has never read in a staged [photo-op](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2020/06/05/george-floyd-protests-trump-church-photo-curfew-park/3127684001/) for his evangelical base who choose what parts of the Bible to follow and which to ignore.

Is it any wonder why there is so much distrust for the trump** administration and police??

That is why athletes take a knee during the National Anthem, it has nothing to do with hating America or hating soldiers or hating the flag, merely peacefully & silently bringing national attention to widespread police brutality.

Perhaps the most ironic lesson to be taken from last summer is that peaceful protests against violent police brutality were met by even more violent, senseless police brutality to quiet their voices!

A lasting tribute to America under trump** we should all be ashamed of...

I despise Trump (obviously) BUT I think that he is a talented showman/huckster. IMO, his speeches are (usually) captivating and entertaining because he always manages to say something controversial or stupid. He always manages to lie or make an ass of himself.

Love him or hate him, most of the country will be interested in what Trump has to say tomorrow, whether they admit it or not. This is an extremely important speech in regards to the future of the Donald Trump brand.

Trump faces a dilemma tomorrow; he is damned if does make “election fraud” the main focus of his speech and damned if he doesn’t make it the main focus. 


*Trump has backed himself into an untenable position.* When he solicits votes for himself or any other GOP candidate he is implicitly suggesting the “election fraud” issue was an anomaly and unlikely to transpire again.

Anything less than total commitment to some kind of extreme measures to fix the “election fraud” will be seen by conservatives as a weak handed response. Anything less than commitment to an armed coup will upset his most ardent and extreme followers.

It will be interesting to see how he attempts to work his way around this issue. The smartest move here might be to take the easy way out- don’t commit to anything and make your speech vague as possible, with no promises or commitments to anything or anyone.

I know there’s some dubious claims made in the preceding paragraphs about females not risking their lives. Regardless I want to try to understand the point she’s making. 


My question is- in exactly what way does women’s submission (highlighted part) prove the first part of that sentence?

Image description: a picture of a page with a highlighted passage (“But it is above and beyond all sexual specification that the existent seeks self-justification in the movement of his transcendence: *the very submission of women proves this*.”)  from the Borde/ Malovany-Chevallier translation of The Second Sex, which reads:  

...supreme value for man but that it must serve ends far greater than itself. The worst curse on woman is her exclusion from warrior expeditions; it is not in giving life but in risking his life that man raises himself above the animal; this is why throughout humanity, superiority has been granted not to the sex that gives birth but to the one that kills. 

Here we hold the key to the whole mystery. On a biological level, a species maintains itself only by re-creating itself; but this creation is nothing but a repetition of the same Life in different forms. By transcending Life through Existence, man guarantees the repetition of Life: by this surpassing, he creates values that deny any value to pure repetition. With an animal, the gramitousness and variety of male activities are useless because no project is involved; what it does is worthless when it is not serving the species; but in serving the species, the human male shapes the face of the earth, creates new instruments, invents and forges the future. Positing himself as sovereign, he encounters the complicity of woman herself: because she herself is also an existent, because transcendence also inhabits her and her project is not repetition but surpassing herself toward another future; she finds the confirmation of masculine claims in the core of her being. She participates with men in festivals that celebrate the success and victories of males. Her misfortune is to have been biologically destined to repeat Life, while in her own eyes Life in itself does not provide her reasons for being, and these reasons are more important than life itself. 

Certain passages where Hegel's dialectic describes the relationship of master to slave would apply far better to the relationship of man to woman. The Master's privilege, he states, arises from the affirmation of Spirit over Life in the fact of risking his life: but in fact the vanquished slave has exoerienced this same risk, whereas the woman is originally an existent who gives Life and does not risk her life; there has never been combat between the male and her; Hegel's definition applies singularly to her. ""The other [consciousness] is the dependent consciousness for which essential reality is animal life, that is, life given by another entity."" But this relationship differs from the relationship of oppression because woman herself aspires to and recognizes the values concretely attained by males. It is the male who opens up the future toward which she also transcends; in reality, women have never pitted female values against male ones: it is men wanting to maintain masculine prerogatives who invented this division; they wanted to create a feminine domain— a rule of life, of immanence— only to lock woman in it. But it is above and beyond all sexual specification that the existent seeks self-justification in the movement of his transcendence: (start highlighted text) the very submission of women proves this. (end highlighted text) Today what women claim is to be recog-",1613164262.0

It’s not limited to people who  are pious or who practice Islam actively, but also a platform for people  who have drifted away from the religion and have maybe practised it at  some point in their life (been part of the Muslim community at some  stage). It can also include people who know someone in this community  who has struggled with mental health.

The  objective of the page is to start conversations around mental health in  an attempt to remove the stigma associated with mental health in the  Muslim community and acknowledge that mental health exists and needs to  be normalized, just as much as physical health.

The format of the page will be similar to that of Humans of New York (HONY)

We  will collect stories that people submit to us that describe what their  experience has been like with mental health and Islam, and share them on  our page like HONY does. We will have options for people to either  share their pictures with us that we can use OR for people to be  entirely anonymous (no names, pictures or any indicator of identity).

I came across this video a while back (I didn't watch it as I refused to but looked up what happened...what happened to this poor woman...god). The movie is called No Good Deed and this scene is where a woman becomes the victim of her psycho ex after he confronts her on whether or not she cheated on him. What happened to herself was already horrific enough. And how one or two of the characters in the film reacted with a complete lack of compassion towards her was also terrible. But what I found the most horrific in regards to response to this scene was the comments on the video. People laughed, people said it was deserved, some said they didn't care...on and on. A few people said that they were all being vile for saying what they did in response to this poor woman. I posted a few comments saying they same and people still continue to scoff and laugh at this. I've tried to get it out of my mind...but still getting notifications of the same horrific messages and responses...it just goes to show what some people think about how women being the victims of the worst of men. 

If you read the comments...you'll see the complete lack of compassion in several of them...some saying she deserved what happened...some laughing at what happened in a way that makes fun of her for how she acts and what instantly happens in response. Can't remember at the moment if some said they didn't care because she cheated or slept with a married man (which is still horrifying how they see no horror in what they've said).

It just presents how in some people there's no sense of any level of sorrow or terror when women are being victimized.

Did I Overreact to this sexist remark?,Liberal,6,ksv21l,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ksv21l/did_i_overreact_to_this_sexist_remark/,6,"I need some help understanding an encounter I just had with my brother. He is generally not very empathetic toward women's issues or the goals of feminism, and at one time we were both entrenched in the conservative movement, which led to us forming the opinion that third wave feminism was pointless man-hating. We haven't been in that movement for quite some time, now (it was just a rebellious phase against the largely liberal culture we grew up in), but it sometimes influences the way I perceive his comments. Since then, I've become much more involved in the movement for gender equality. This started when I came out and began diving into the ligbtq+ community, which generally supports racial and gender equality. This encouraged my interest in feminism, to which I'm fairly new. So I wanted to post the interaction here to ask if I'm overreacting. 
 
My brother showed me a picture of a fairly unattractive man and said ""if he slapped your girl's ass, would you beat him?"" I said ""if he slapped MY ass, I'd call the police bc it's completely unacceptable to touch a woman like that without consent"" and he said ""it's a meme, Meg"" as if I was sucking the fun out of a joke by pointing out that it perpetuates rape culture and degrades women. (I emphasized that ""MY"" because I don't think the situation should be framed from the perspective of the woman's partner. It implies that she is their property and therefore the crime has really been committed against THEM, not her. It also suggests that she needs her partner to do something because she can't handle the situation herself even though she is the one who has been sexually assaulted.) 

Meme or not, I didn't think this was an okay thing to say. 

Keep in mind that we share a love for dark/edgy humor when it's done well, and there has never been any truth in the racist, sexist, or homophopic jokes we would tell. We're both of the mind that such jokes are best used when the intention is to show the ridiculousness of those beliefs. (Example: Making a joke about how black people are criminals points out the ridiculousness of that stereotype and ultimately makes racists, not black people.) However, I don't think this particular ""joke"" does that. The sexism of it is not the part that is supposed to be funny. The part that is supposed to be funny is that the man is not attractive. The sexism and perpetuation of rape culture lies in the setup, not the punchline. Which makes me feel like pointing it out is important because the person making the joke may not have even realized that it had these undertones. Do you think I'm overreacting or do you think the joke was inappropriate? Please give your honest opinion, I'm not afraid to be wrong.",1610079986.0

Looking for help for a young woman -,Liberal,3,kop0n1,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/kop0n1/looking_for_help_for_a_young_woman/,2,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I'm really struggling to try to find the right resources for a young woman I met online, who needs some help. I stumbled across her question on the Quora site where she asked a question that hinted at some trouble at home & when I saw the original question, I saw that she had added some frustration that people were rude to her & part of my life staying sober is trying to help people who seem to need help, mostly because no one helped me growing up. We have a saying, that you try to Do The Next Right Thing.

I commented on the post that I was going to send her a private message & I have a 26 year old daughter who is also sober & if I ever reach out to a young woman, I always offer to set them up with my daughter if they are uncomfortable talking to a man. I offered to answer the question & which started a steady exchange of emails with this young woman.

She's 20 years old, she lived in North Carolina, & her mother took her out of public school in the 7th grade & has not only sheltered her from a more social life, but she to this day, actively shadows her, if she goes to her college class, the mother will drive her there, & hang out to watch her. Her mother forced her to take classes that the mother felt were good, mostly in cyber security & IT stuff, but she wants to be a chef some day.

She's been assaulted by family members in the past & everything she has is monitored, she has no idea what her absent father pays in support, & she's never seen any evidence that she's getting a benefit in that way. Her mother signed up for social services & added other children that don't live there for extra cash & food stamps. She controls the daughter's bank account, & she's been getting new credit cards in the daughter's name.

I know that some may read this & wonder why I trust some kid I don't know & I don't really want to write about my past & how I was raised to defend myself, & I ask that you just work on the assumption that she's honest & very believable. She has reported her mother several times, to police, to her grandmother's health aids, to the therapists & psychiatrists her mother sent her too, & its pretty clear that people don't want to get too involved & her mother is talented at talking it away.

She's really very intelligent, & I would say brave as well, but she's very naive, admittedly, she knows that she doesn't know what a lot of 20 year olds should know & she's pretty desperate to escape at this point. The only advice she's gotten from the few adults that have seen the abuse, has been, she should steal the car & run away, join the military or find a man to date or marry & hope he's nice. I'm sure that most of us can see the futility & real danger that could result in.

I've been trying to search online for organizations that help young women, to find her some resources. I'm very hesitant to just report it to her local child services & such because so far they haven't done much good & I worry that if we take action that doesn't work, things will get much worse for her. Really all I'm hoping for is that someone here can give me a name, an organization, something solid I can pursue & if not that, some direction on perhaps making a plea to the public or a reporter that likes to do personal stories of people in need - anything that could create the opportunity she needs to live her own life. I promise you, she's a remarkable young person & if given the chance, she will make the best of it. 

Thanks for reading this at least.  - Nic",1609555191.0

"Dark and Light Beauty- Female Archetypes, Meanings/Realities (and the portrayal of how their roles need to be changed)",Liberal,13,kcm3ks,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/kcm3ks/dark_and_light_beauty_female_archetypes/,3,"Throughout fiction and history, there's been a major contrast between two 'types of women'. (Granted there are obviously more, but this is focused on the two mentioned. There's a conflict not just between the two personally (usually) but also a conflict between their deeper meanings and how a woman could/'should' be. And these archetypes don't refer to skin tone (though it's ironic some characters from either type may have at least one physical trait associated with the title (ex. hair color).)

Light Beauty- A character who presents that form of 'innocence' or 'purity', deriving the position as the 'good girl/woman'. She is dependent on others whether or not she likes it or realizes it or not. Being 'submissive' and 'obedient' are also part of what makes this character the way she is. Stories of her trying to shed or keep her 'purity' are one of the major conflicts in the plot. This entwines within how girls will sometimes try to remain 'pure', with this usually if not always meaning sex. From having this emplored by those who raise her to be this way so she can be 'moral' and 'pure'. Also dressing modestly or being sure not to question/oppose authority or to make herself being the authoritative figure. People will often 'speak for her', trying to keep her the way they want her to (usually by men, but sadly other women do this as well). She is pushed to be meek by those in her environment as she can remain pure and to make sure she doesn't become an 'undesirable', 'heathen', or any/all of the degrading terms used to describe women who are liberated (especially sexually), etc. She is 'respected' but not desired.

Dark Beauty- A character who is the opposite of the Light Beauty (obviously). She is independent, worldly, a woman with perhaps some semblance of power, and not under the command of any man. For this she is portrayed as 'wicked', that she doesn't conform to society's rules (specifically a patriarchy's) and that everything that makes her what she is immoral and/or unholy. She gets what she wants/tries to get what she wants through different means: sexual, manipulation, will, or violence. Stories portray her as a woman who defies the 'will of the people' (usually sexist/misogynistic men and women who are indoctrinated/forced into that way of thinking) and must be stopped from getting what she seeks (and is often 'stopped' most of the time/all the time, with it ending up with her imprisonment or death). Women who enjoy and seek sex, wish to have some kind of power/authority in the world, and/or want to be free of controlling rules (about any or all of these things) set by their parents, husband, family, etc. are linked to this trope. She is desired, but not respected. They are called all the degrading and horrible terms women have been and are stilled called to this day. (Sub archetypes of the Dark Beauty are the Femme Fatale, the Witch, the Vampiress, and the She-Wolf/Werewolf which I discussed in another post.) They are also examples of women who the worst of men use to 'justify' their belief in not trusting women and to control women. 

Relationship between the two: The Dark and Light Beauty are very much opposites. One is sexual and free, while the other is conservative and obedient. One is usually depicted as older than the other and presents the more worldly and experienced energy. This does not mean the other will see her as such. The Light Beauty is said to envy or emulate the Dark Beauty, but so many stories present it as her despising her. The Light Beauty perceives the Dark Beauty as what her upbringing has warned her not to be: rebellious, sexual, self-interested, immoral, etc. And with how these stories go, the Dark Beauty may envy the Light Beauty's innocence or will have disdain for her (which is portrayed as villainous). She may try to 'save' the Light Beauty from becoming like her, that she may stay 'pure' or try to rescue her from her innocence (though this usually is very rare and often goes with the way of her being wrong about what the Light Beauty should be). 

For Change: Given for how long the 'role' of the woman has been depicted to be/should be that of the Light Beauty and that the Dark Beauty is an abomination to be weeded out is just another example of the attempts/means to keep women 'under control'. The Light Beauty isn't necessarily bad in herself for not having knowledge of the world, not having acted on ones' desires, etc. isn't bad. Yet it doesn't mean it should be put on a pedestal or something that be used as an example to hate those who don't follow that path. The Dark Beauty has been the victim and unfortunate scapegoat of patriarchal/woman-hating individuals to try to manipulate women into being that of the stereotypical Light BEauty: obedient, submissive, and under control. For a woman to be liberated (sexually and intellectually), to seek and obtain her own power/authority, to rebel against those who would seek to control her and other women, etc. is aspirational. Desire is something we all have, in any and all forms. With these two archetypes, it tells tales both fictional and nonfictional of what some believe women 'should be and not be'. But to portray the Dark Beauty as someone women could/should be and for the Light Beauty as women once were/a warning of what to not always be. (For the Dark Beauty is liberated and the Light Beauty isn't...and women should be free.)

(I hope this was a thought-provoking and meaningful analysis/suggestion of two defining female archetypes and personalities. That and how the nature of women's desires isn't evil and that to act on them/embrace what you all want is something freeing and empowering. Let me know what y'all think and stay safe.)",1607904194.0

This scandalous feminist book that was almost banned by French author Pauline Harmange debates the differences between misogyny and misandry, and takes a closer look on sexism and patriarchal social structures.

Why women have the right to be distrustful and cautious, and the ideas of female solidarity as well as sisterhood are topics of it.

It is not, as the title might suggest (and unlike misogynist structures) a call for violence, but more so one to question our perspectives.

I have read it, and I can truly recommend it for every woman.

When reading/listening to the book, despite it being written solely based on gender structures, you probably won't be able to ignore how it contains parallels to racial structures, sexuality structures or others as well.",1607169312.0

I know I'm not completely innocent of making this false assumption; I do it too, but so many comments seem to go out of their way to confirm that you are, indeed, a man. I once made a post about my experience with ADHD without including the fact that I'm a cis-woman and the first comment was ""this guy knows how to ADHD!"" Yesterday, I saw a popular post about what was clearly a mother dog being cute with her puppy and the top comment referred to the dog as ""he."" It feels silly to point out these pretty minor mishaps, but when you see it over and over and over again it just feels so blatantly ignorant. Once you start taking note, it's hard to not notice.

A Call for Unity among Radical Feminists in the Fight to Amend the Equality Act,Liberal,20,k1nprk,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/k1nprk/a_call_for_unity_among_radical_feminists_in_the/,29,"**Feminists in Struggle (FIST) have posted an Open Letter from Feminists in Struggle to the Interim Steering Committee of the Women’s Human Rights Campaign USA: A Call for Unity among Radical Feminists in the Fight to Amend the Equality Act.**

FIST's Open Letter notes that the Interim Steering Committee (ISC) of the Women’s Human Rights Campaign (WHRC) recently released the “Equality for All Act,” its own version of an amended Equality Act (EA), a bill pending in Congress that would add “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” as protected sub-classes under the category of “sex” in federal discrimination laws.

--

FIST's Open Letter notes that the revision of the bill that the ISC has produced is less comprehensive and actually far less protective of the sex-based rights of women and girls than FIST’s Feminist Amendments to the Equality Act that pre-date ISC’s version by more than a year.

--

FIST believes that the approach of FIST’s Feminist Amendments is significantly more protective of sex-based rights than ISC’s draft bill for two reasons: 

  1.   the Feminist Amendments spell out that female-only spaces and programs do not constitute discrimination based on sex or sex stereotyping; and 

  1.  the Feminist Amendments make robust findings about the subordinate status of women in society, the pervasive nature of male violence, and the need for women-only spaces and programs in the interests of achieving true equality for the female sex.

So which female great authors - who have meant something for you - and which of their publications would advise me to read?

"The Femme Fatale, the Witch, the Vampiress, and the She-Wolf/Werewolf: Powerful and Tragic Female Tropes and/or Archetypes",Liberal,50,juc54c,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/juc54c/the_femme_fatale_the_witch_the_vampiress_and_the/,16,"Throughout so many stories, there are various roles, icons, and places women have occupied. Not many as the four above present controversial, strong, and sadly (as so often, or practically all the time) tragic in manner. These figures present both a metaphorical and literal meaning to female characters and women in general (whether human or not). Each has been presented sadly as the 'villain' who must be killed or jailed and/or a woman who must be 'saved, tamed, or cured'. Such figures hopefully will one day be portrayed with so many/some of the traits that make them who they are without them having the endings they endure as stated above.

Femme Fatale- As the literal definition says: An attractive and seductive woman, especially one who will ultimately bring disaster to a man who becomes involved with her. These women (as each of the characters/tropes are, or in some presentations) are physically gorgeous who men are drawn to like moths to the flame. They are temptation given physical form. They are cunning, confident, and promiscuous women who use sex for their means and/or just have sex for fun. These women are practically patriarchy and misogyny's worst nightmare come to life. With this, they are 'dealt with' in usually a couple of ways in stories: killed (with the poor woman usually begging for her life), thrown into jail (with her usually begging to not be thrown into jail), or shown to be 'not so bad' and becomes a 'good, submissive woman'. She is spoken about with desperate lust and derogatory means (and she's sometimes physically and/or verbally assaulted for being an 'immoral woman'). This is a woman who sometimes, or usually, has dealt with the worst parts of men and how they view/treat women. She acts in a way that's best for her, using men's desires against them to get what she wants and needs. Sadly, she is 'foiled' in what she desires. There are some instances where she succeeds (but there are so few of them). This a woman who should be portrayed as the seductive and cunning woman she is who uses her wiles and confidence to take down the men who hurt women lie her and women in general whilst building up the presentation of a woman being sexual, confident, and going for what she desires as something women should try to be. A woman who can get what she wants and acts on obtaining that what she desires: wealth, power, vengeance, etc. in ways that prove women can use what they have to beat the system and come out on top. To show the men who think women shouldn't be sexual, confident, etc. that they cannot be stopped and that women can dominate.

The Witch- Stories of sorcery have existed for practically since humanity began. Magic is powerful and a witch is a powerful woman. However, magic is so often portrayed as evil, and the woman who uses it is portrayed as evil as well. The inner strength she has is something that is feared by the masses, by both men and women, and rumors/warnings are told to avoid such women and/or to run them off. Women accused of witchcraft were murdered in various ways, the most well known being burning, for centuries. The witch is also portrayed as a woman who hates children. She is depicted as a woman who desires sex but not to have children. A woman to have sex just for pleasure is so often deemed as 'immoral' and that a woman should have sex just for children. (This is a trait the Witch has in common with the Femme Fatale, having sex for pleasure and desire rather than to be a mother.) She is seen as something a woman 'shouldn't be': powerful, strong, and indulgent in desires not for the sake of children. She is usually killed in many horrific ways as a 'punishment' as an act against God or the Church, or in humanity in general. She is an 'enemy of faith' and that she belongs to the Devil. The Witch is sometimes portrayed in a more 'favorable' fashion, called a 'light witch' sometimes usually becoming 'too powerful'/used to empower those to likely fight those who are also disenfranchised (ex. the Buffy series and girls would become 'slayers' to slaughter an entire species) or portrayed in a way that she 'has' to give up her magic to become a common woman. The Witch's power is something that should be portrayed as someone who uses their power to empower themselves and other women, to be strong in a way that makes certain people nervous (which it should) so that those hurt by powers that oppress women to be a 'certain way' can feel powerless and be brought down by those they sought to eradicate. To also empower women to act on the desire for sex and not just to be a mother/to have children, to feel the thrill of ecstasy of pleasure, and to feel empowered in their sexuality.

The Vampiress- In many ways, this is a combination of both the Femme Fatale and the Witch. Lore of vampires goes as far back as the Sumerian Age, about 6,000 to 7,000 years ago. A being who drank the blood of humans and animals to survive. In some cases, a 'female' entity who drank the blood of men was one such very early story that continued throughout the millennia. She is the Femme Fatale with her own magic and not just her beauty (which the Witch sometimes has). She uses her feminine wiles and her supernatural hypnosis/compulsion to lure in men for her to feed on (and sometimes sleep with). She's seductive, strong, and highly intelligent. A woman of supernatural prowess who is stronger and smarter than any man. With this, she's seen as a monster. Vampires are predators and they do what they do to survive. But humanity doesn't exactly like the idea of not being at the top of the food chain (though that's not completely true for vampires, but more on that later). If a human woman becomes a vampire, she goes through a change not of the body, but of the mind as well. Her personality is strengthened and heightened just like her physical prowess. She becomes more confident in herself and what she can do. This is seen as an aberration by many. (Ex. in Vamp U, college women become vampires and they are gradually hunted by the vampire who made them, another vampiress, and humans (one of who claims he wouldn't have killed her if she wasn't a vampire; another scene includes one vampiress being sexual and she's staked through a bed with several spikes, both were hard to watch (on a side note, seeing women being killed in film and/or TV is very hard to watch, it's tragic and infuriating). The vampiress who helps kill the others was called 'humble' as if being confident vampiress was evil in itself (the spectrum between arrogance and humility is complicated, and it's sad when a woman is being confident it's seen as 'monstrous'; plus, an 'overconfident' woman is a refreshing as society tries to beat into women to be 'humble and submissive'). She is sometimes killed, like the one vampiress in Vamp U, in sexual or intimate moments, suggesting her seductive nature was also her greatest 'weakness' and led to 'brave men' killing the 'monster'. The Vampiress should be portrayed as the intelligent, seductive, and cunning figure she is. Drinking blood to survive and using her supernatural gifts to defeat such men (and given) and women who seek the slaughter of her and those like her. But also, to use her gifts to achieve not only her survival but her to thrive in life. She would act on her sexual desires and her need for blood, but not kill those unless they are such men who seek her death and those like her.

The She-Wolf/Werewolf- This has similarities to the others (obviously most with the Vampiress) yet is unique in its own way. Stories of werewolves and other shapeshifting beings have existed since humanity painted and drew on cave walls. The werewolf is one of the most infamous of supernatural beings and one of the most feared. A being nigh unstoppable and more ferocious than perhaps almost any known supernatural being. The apex of apex predators, the ultimate hunter, and perhaps the perfect predators. Tied with the woman, this makes the she-wolf a mystic, primal force of nature. Lately, the wolf is linked with desire and one's 'animal nature'/'the beast within'. Such things are considered evil and inhuman, that one is capable of becoming a beast is seen as possibly the greatest evil or one of the greatest. The werewolf is so often to be killed and usually is, but it's presented as an almost impossible task given the superhuman resilience of the lycanthrope and the utter carnage of which one can unleash. When in human form, the woman has some of her bestial traits, including hypersexual and aggressive tendencies. The wolf is supposed to be linked with a girl's/woman's 'coming of age' or linking with her sexual nature. (Ex. in Ginger Snaps, where the main/title character becomes a werewolf and she explores and revels in her heightened sexual desire and acts on her anger. To only later, sadly, to be killed by the one she loved most.) But the wolf is also could be seen as the woman's most 'corrupt part', the being who acts on pure desire and hunger, without 'reason'. Given the sense, it's 'mindless'. But women, like wolves, are meant to run wild and free. Wolves are ferocious when they need to be and act for the survival and happiness of themselves and those they care for. The werewolf also shouldn't be presented as something evil, rather a being whose duality helps sets free and strengthens both the person and the wolf. With women, to be free to act on desire and to be confident in their hunger and strength is something that should truly be manifested. The She-Wolf/Werewolf should present a woman who either becomes a werewolf or already is one that shows women that being free to act on their desire and being so ferocious and powerful that practically none can stand in one's way of what they desire and to make all those who try to go after them realize that they would be/are overwhelmed by the sheer strength and will of the woman, along with the ferocity and protective instinct of the wolf. (As with it, the beast within makes the woman stronger by both existing in harmony rather than trying to suppress/control the beast.)

(Well, I hope this was thought-provoking and something to consider that maybe/possibly could or should happen with the most misunderstood female tropes and/or archetypes. With also possibly presenting new perspectives on how women's lives could be. (Sorry if I'm making too big of a deal out of this. I just really wanted to write this and felt it needed to be said. Y'all stay safe and let me know what y'all think.)",1605398486.0

ICE's forced sterilizations: why we must protect bodily autonomy,Liberal,123,itwj0j,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/itwj0j/ices_forced_sterilizations_why_we_must_protect/,10,"U.S. ICE's actions towards women in its care is atrocious, especially their reproductive health.  They monitor periods, deny abortions including babies of rape, delay release to force women to gestate unwanted babies, refuse to issue masks or gloves, and now we know they're performing hysterectomies on women without their consent.  Some women had their ovaries removed, sending them into menopause unconscionably early.  The lack of medical care for such serious, unnecessary surgeries surely added to the high mortality rate.  This is the latest in a long history of forced sterilization, genocide, and other horrors piled on black and brown people by the white men in charge. 

We cannot allow anyone to control women's bodies.  These kinds of things happen too often.  This is why we must protect bodily autonomy: all women in the US, regardless of citizenship, must have complete control over themselves including their reproductive choices.  To allow others control over women's bodies results in horrors. 

This is the only answer to the abortion ""debate"". ",1600266313.0

On the events in Belarus,Liberal,3,ilslzo,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/ilslzo/on_the_events_in_belarus/,0," What is going on in Belarus is not a “maidan”, it’s a democratic revolution.

The main moving force of this revolution, its backbone, is the working class of Belarus.

Whether this democratic revolution will win or get defeated by the counter-revolution (presented by the yet not overthrown clan of oligarchs led by Lukashenko or presented by the so-called “opposition” reflecting the interests of other groups of the largest capitalist monopolies, including foreign ones), we do not know yet – it will depend on the ratio of the class power in Belarus, on the actions of the classes participating in the revolution, on the working class, on its awareness, cohesiveness and organization.

The democratic revolution in Belarus is not yet going beyond the bourgeois framework and is not seeking to change the social structure radically (to replace the capitalist way of production with the communist way of production), which means that, in its content, this is a bourgeois-democratic, anti-imperialist, anti-fascist revolution. But due to the objective laws of social development, if the leadership (the hegemony) of the working class remains, if the latter manages to coalesce into its class political party of the Bolshevik variety and unite all working folk of Belorussia around itself, this revolution will have every chance to grow into a socialist revolution.

Anyways, I'm having ( as well as lots of other people) this issue that is mentioned in the title. This is gonna be a long post so excuse me. 

Since I was a kid my father would drive near bars that had ""attractive"" women outside to attract customers. He would tell me to check them out and sometimes rate them. 
Along with pornography and other similar incidents/habits these things have made it really hard for me to stop objectifying women. The first thing that comes to my mind when I'm seeing a girl on the street or wherever is to tell if she's beautiful or not. If I'd like to have sex with her or not. And other disgusting things about her body. 

When I went to college, some friends that I made were feminists so that's when I actually came in contact with feminism as well. The girl I'm with has helped me immensely with this issue but still. Deep down I just can't seem to be able to get these things out of my head. Thanks to her I have stopped watching porn but I'm still having issues with ads appearing on my feed and with the women I come across on the street. This is causing terrible issues to our relationship. Her trust has plummeted and her self esteem as well. And it's all my fault. 

But I just can't seem to be able to help it. I am not using this as an excuse but merely as a way to show you how I feel. It's like being an addict. It's a cheap thrill. Small doses every time. It's literally the first thing that comes to my mind and although we have been to the brink of ending our relationship a few times due to this  shit Im still having trouble. 

Reading articles and personal experiences about patriarchy and all that comes with it has done little to nothing. I'm really desperate cause I feel sick everytime I have such a behavior. I havent had anny issues regarding other thing that I'm opposed to like racism, fascism, capitalism etc but this one ( feminism) I'm having huge issues. 

Sorry if my writing was a mess, vocabulary and grammar wise, but English is not my native language. Any help would be highly appreciated. Thank you! 

TL:DR

I can't stop objectifying women and this is causing issues in my relationship as well contradicting my personal values. Help!",1598807220.0

Introduction:

>In this essay I propose that we understand rape as a language and use this insight to imagine women as neither already raped nor inherently rapable. I will argue against the political efficacy of seeing rape as the fixed reality of women's lives, against an identity politics which defines women by our violability, and for a shift of scene from rape and its aftermath to rape situations themselves and to rape prevention. Many current theories of rape present rape as an inevitable material fact of life and assume that a rapist's ability to physically overcome his target is the foundation of rape.  
>  
>Susan Brownmiller represents this view when she states in her influential 1975 book, *Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape*, that ""in terms of human anatomy the possibility of forcible intercourse incontrovertibly exists. This single factor may have been sufficient to have caused the creation of a male ideology of rape. When men discovered that they could rape, they proceeded to do it."" Such a view takes violence as a self-explanatory first cause and endows it with an invulnerable and terrifying facticity which stymies our ability to challenge and demystify rape. To treat rape simply as one of what \[Mary E.\] Hawkesworth calls ""the realities that circumscribe women's lives"" can mean to consider rape as terrifyingly unnameable and unrepresentable, a reality that lies beyond our grasp and which we can only experience as grasping and encircling us. In its efforts to convey the horror and iniquity of rape, such a view often concurs with masculinist culture in its designation of rape as a fate worse than, or tantamount to, death; the apocalyptic tone which it adopts and the metaphysical status which it assigns to rape implies that rape can only be feared or legally repaired, not fought.  
>  
>Feminist antirape literature, activism, and policy development on rape in the United States during the last two decades have increasingly concentrated on police procedures and legal definitions of rape. This focus can produce a sense of futility: rape itself seems to be taken for granted as an occurrence and only postrape events offer possible occasions for intervention. Although feminist drives to change the legal definition of rape, to increase the penalties for rape and to render the terms of a rape trial less prejudicial to the raped woman have publicized rape's seriousness as a crime, an almost exclusive insistence on equitable reparation and vindication in the courts has limited effectiveness for a politics of rape prevention. Quite literally, the rape has already occurred by the time a case comes to court; a verdict of guilty can in no way avert the rape itself, and no one has proven a direct link between increased penalties and convictions for a crime and a decreased incidence of that crime. The notorious racism and sexism of the United States police and legal systems often compromise the feminist goals of a rape trial.

Evidence of CIA involvement in the Alt Right and Reddit/4chan,Liberal,5,hml56x,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/hml56x/evidence_of_cia_involvement_in_the_alt_right_and/,1," I'm gonna post this all across Reddit, 4chan etc because it relates to these communities. This is what I have spent the last month of lockdown doing. I have titled this article, 'The Truth About The Alt Right: A Destruction By Facts and Logic.' Part of the reason I write this article is that I sincerely hope those on the Alt-Right consider its implications and question their beliefs. The other part is that I sincerely hope the left begins to more fully understand the scope of the alt-right itself, but also of the intelligence agencies who, I believe I have shown in this article, are the creators and backers of the alt-right movement. I hope that perhaps they might consider what they could do to combat these influences specifically online.

While the alt-right have money, we have a lot of people. In the article I first outline who the alt right are and what they believe, as well as outlining a fairly orthodox theory of where fascism comes from. I then discuss The Roots of the Alt Right and the connections to intelligence agencies therein, their relationship to the conspiracy theory community and other alternative media. I also give a brief history of 4chan. I then discuss the Alt-Right itself, the alt-right specific theories such as Pizzagate and Qanon, as well as the alt-rights involvement the election of Donald Trump.

From here, I go on to discuss the various different groups and interests who put large amounts of money behind the election of Donald Trump. This money paid for the astroturfing of various forums on the internet, including Reddit and 4chan, by these paid meme magic factories. Those who paid for these factories are some interesting characters, including one Jim Dowson, part of a shadowy group called The Knights Templar International, ruled by a mysterious 'Council of Nine'. Yes, you heard me correctly.

Outside of these interests, I also show the massive and blatant amount of intelligence agency interference in these communities. I then go on discuss the esoteric leanings of many of these Neo Nazi groups implicated in this astroturfing campaign, as well as their own connections to intelligence groups, which are often direct and stark. I discuss generally how these various influences have formed a militant anti left bloc, with global reach and influence as well as considerable militant capabilities. This network forms a Fascist International and has links right to the top of many states. 4Chan and Reddit have been a key media outlet in their growth.

I am aware the article is very long, so if you have a pretty good grasp 4chan/Reddit history, you can skip ahead to the section, Entitled 'The God Emporer Saves Us From His Pedophile Friends' , or, if you want to get straight to the sections most relevant to 4chan and Reddit, you can skip to the section entitled 'Evidence of Glow Posting'. It is from this section of the article that the whole thing grew. I wanted to collect the little evidence I had of glow posting into one document, that lead here and there and now I have over 20,000 words. You will find that at the start of the article in the introduction there are few citations, don't assume that is because I don't use them, I reference 143 sources in total. This is a link to the article. Hope you find it interesting.

We have [a document explaining this community's goal and principles](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/wiki/about). We've also instituted formal rules and additional documentation as concrete examples and to make it clearer and easier for community members to report transgressions.

[Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is a site-wide baseline that volunteer moderators enforce. In particular Reddit prohibits [Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or). This is synchronous with our Rule 3, *Oppressive Attitudes and Actions*. NB We've explicitly included the axis of sex.

We have [rules and guidelines for submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/wiki/submissions). We've instituted an [Accessibility Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/wiki/accessibility) and provide some useful information. This also applies to links in comments.

Reporting content is the best way to surface rule violations to moderators. Every other method requires that we explicitly check it, which in most cases means it gets lost in the clutter. Thank you to our community members who do!

They insist that because most sitcoms are about a family where the mother is always the smart one & the father is always the dumb one that that is someone oppressive of men.

What they fail to realise (or it's just an act) is that there is a comedy dynamic as old as time where one character is ""the funny man"" & the other character is ""the straight man"". In family-based sitcoms the mother is almost always ""the straight man"" & they are usually a conventionally attractive Mary Sue to boot. They usually only get that stupid smart alecky type of humour (same as the kids).  
Conversely, being stupid is funny, hence why the funny man is often just a moron.

The funny man gets all the laughs. People tune in to see the funny man. The funny man is typically the main character. So if anything, this dynamic, which is always passed off by MRAs as prejudicial against men is actually just another example of sexism in media (not in individual instances, necessarily, but because a trend can be observed).

(Plus, the MRA argument is cherry picking, since there is a large variety of male characters on TV & film, who vastly outnumber female characters, meaning male representation has got the quality, as well as the quantity)",1593960284.0

Help me educate my friend about the patriarchy,Liberal,55,hb0yzh,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/hb0yzh/help_me_educate_my_friend_about_the_patriarchy/,40,"Hey everyone! This is my first post here,!

A good male friend of mine, who is ""woke"" about a lot of things, just surprised me by telling me he doesn't believe in the patriarchy and that it's just a victim mindset. We were texting and here's how the conversation went:

Him: ""I dont really believe too heavily in the patriarchy I feel like it's a victim mindset. Most people who get shot are men, most people in prison are men, most homeless people are men, most suicides are male."" 

Me: ""Woooow"" 

Him: ""It's true though"" 

Me: ""Okay I'm not going to get into this because it's sleep time for me but seriously please do actual research before making statements like that. And as for the suicide rate I'm really surprised you didn't learn in psych about the fact that the only reason male suicide is higher is because they use more lethal means because they don't care what they look like and the clean up after they die but women do because, patriarchy. Women attempt suicide significantly more than men do.

The patriarchy doesn't just negatively impact women, it impacts men as well. Just do the research because you're smart and if you actually look into it and it's roots and statistics and the reasons for statistics you will definitely change your mind.""

Him:""Oh I know that men typically use more lethal means while women don't that's well known. Why would less lethal suicide methods be due to a patriarchy?
I'm open minded so fill me in I'm eager to know
 Feminists are amazing but there's some who go too far and pretend like there's an issue when there's not
There's lots of things that are bad for men, such as the other examples to only name a few""

Me:  I can find information for you but it's not my job to educate you on it. The patriarchy made those things. Men aren't supposed to show emotions so they don't get help for their issues so they kill themselves =patriarchy. I'll send stuff tomorrow
Night night x""

Him: ""Awesome, night night  x"" 

He's obviously wrong and it hurt me he actually feels this way. I'm heading to bed for the night and quite frankly have no energy to help educate him. He's very open to learning more though, so I thought this would be a great sub for me to find and share resources with him. If this post gets any traction I'll definitely show it to him. 
So I'm asking for you lovely people to share any information and resources about the patriarchy and its effects on society (including men).
 TIA for your help!",1592430591.0

It really upsets me to see my friends getting married so young - what is this disgust rooted in???,Liberal,11,h0lxh0,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/h0lxh0/it_really_upsets_me_to_see_my_friends_getting/,9,"So I'm originally from a small Texas town. It's mainly conservative but the population has grown immensely in the past 5 years and it's close to Austin, so you can find all types unlike other small Texas towns. Now I'm currently a 22 year old woman and at least a dozen of the girls that were on my high school dance team with me (Ages 19-24) are already married, some even with children. 

About a year ago one of my old close friends from the dance team got married kind of out of the blue. She had gone off to college in an actual small, heavily conservative Christian town, and naturally it followed she was engaged by junior year. I never even met her husband until their wedding day which was extra weird because I was close enough to the family to be in the wedding party. Now she's pregnant and so excited to be giving birth at the end of this year and just announced her pregnancy publically. And essentially everytime I get news of another engagement or pregnancy I feel disgusted. Not in the ""I'm afraid that I'm being left behind"" way, in kind of an overbearing mom kind of way. Like ""no babe you can't undo that decision and you still have plenty of time for family."" 

When trying to look around for women with a similar feeling, the only things I could find were the classic 'I'm 35 and single and seeing other people already settled down is hard because I'm afraid I won't get that."" I want to make it clear that I feel mine is a separate reaction, rooted in the exact opposite perspective. Not ""I'm running out of time"" but more of a ""what's the rush if you're so young?""

Part of me wonders if this is some kind of internalized shame but more specifically if this emotion is prevalent amongst other feminists? Like is this disgust rooted in me being secretly afraid that their adherence to an outdated social norm will force it back onto all women? If I truly support a woman's right to choose like I claim I do, why does it bother me so much to see my young friends making that choice?",1591828141.0
Thoughts on reclaiming “hormonal?”,Liberal,16,h0engq,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/h0engq/thoughts_on_reclaiming_hormonal/,5,"When I was pregnant, I had a family member dismiss a lot of my feelings with “you’re just hormonal.” Post-pregnancy, I was talking to two family members that I’ve had relationship problems with for about a year and a half. I have been trying to get us all talking about what’s going on so that we can resolve things. They came out with “we couldn’t talk with you when you were pregnant, because you were so hormonal.” 

So, I’m pretty offended, but it got me thinking: how would they feel if when they wanted to talk to me I said, “I’m feeling too hormonal to talk to you right now.” It would be legitimate, because their lashing out at me has been the cause of my only experiences with post-partum depression.

What do you think? Is it giving them the win? Admitting that we have hormones and they affect us? (I cried at sad movies, fed my elderly cat by hand when he was being picky, and adopted a pair of rabbits a friend couldn’t keep. And I was still very capable of maintaining human relationships and conversations)

So what if “hormonal” wasn’t something that other people used on us to shut us down, but something we used on them to shut them down? The mature part of me says that no one should be shut down, but I also want “oh, you’re just being hormonal” to go die in a fire.",1591807529.0

Out of the 9/10 not sexually violated, a majority have to change their schedules and activities to protect themselves and many fear being assaulted. If they went to parties and got blackout drunk, did solo travel in foreign countries where they don't speak the language, stayed at strangers' houses, hitchhiked, went walking alone at midnight like many boys do then over 9/10 would be raped or at least sexually assaulted. Don't credit me entirely for this statement because I am paraphrasing another feminist whose comment I saw and vaguely remember.

And yes, not all men rape. It's a tiny minority of the male population who rape and assault women. But the thing is that predators don't have a big red flag on their foreheads, so we have to be careful with all men. So it shouldn't be seen as unreasonable if we want to meet our SOs in public and get to know them before meeting up in private, if we are wary of men walking on the street, or we don't want unsupervised male babysitters for our children. Yes men get raped/assaulted too but most victims are female and most perpetrators are men, the reason for this being biological (men are stronger and bigger and it's easier to force penetration than it is to force someone to penetrate), so men don't fear it in their everyday lives as much as women do.",1589589437.0

Just starting The Second Sex and I have some questions,Liberal,32,gbzpsl,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/gbzpsl/just_starting_the_second_sex_and_i_have_some/,5,"In her intro to the book, Judith Thurman states,

>...a substantial body of research in biology and the social sciences supports their argument that some sexual differences (besides the obvious ones) are innate rather than “situational.”


Since she doesn’t cite her sources there, my question to you lovely people is, which differences are generally accepted by the scientific community as innate and not simply produced by social conditioning (to clarify, the differences I consider obvious are anatomical, metabolic, and hormonal ones)? What studies might she be talking about? Links to peer-reviewed articles or references to specific studies I can go find myself would be helpful.


I know the answers to these questions are not black and white and our personhoods are the result of complex interactions between our biology and our environment. I’m not a biological essentialist and at this point I’m very much on Beauvoir’s side that women are made and not born, but I also feel that having a good evidence-based grasp of what is nature and what is nurture is essential not only to understanding the claims of this book but being a good feminist in general.

I'm 24 and I've been a radical feminist for a few years now. I want to ask my fellow heterosexual radical feminists (if there's any of us here), how do you reconcile your feminist convictions with you needs for intimacy and a relationship? As I'm getting older I see my friends entering relationships, getting engaged and so on, while I remain single as a pingle. I have a very good life I built around my relationships with women but not gonna lie, I increasingly find myself longing for intimacy and closeness that comes with having a partner. Morning kisses, sitting on someone's laps, cuddles... 

I tried dating but I'm heterosexual and the men out there... Subpar, exploitative, and boring individuals. It's almost palpable when they get uncomfortable when I assert myself. I respect myself, my experience, my knowledge and I won't cater for anyone's insecurities and make myself small. The men I have so far met are either not interested in dating someone like me, or straight up feel threatened by me. 
I tried hooking up, so at least my sexual needs are met, but it left me feeling even more desperate for the real intimate bond with someone.
I have close male friends but not partner material either. 

What should I do now? Should I keep on looking for a rare gem among men? Are there any decent men out there at all? Is there hope for me?
It's been bugging me for such a long time now... The intrusive thoughts telling me that if I shaved, wore makeup, make myself more agreeable, I could be in a fulfilling relationship...",1583612284.0

*Radio Freedom* is a compilation album, featuring twenty political/protest songs in all styles of music: metal, folk, hip hop, and more.

The long-term aim of the project is to establish a worker-owned, for-profit record label.

Politically-aware  musicians often have two choices: make money for a  company that goes  against everything they believe in, or go 'DIY' and  live in poverty.

Musicians shouldn't have to choose between making a difference and making a living.

The musicians on *Radio Freedom* will get a percentage which is well over the industry norm.

The funding goal represents the cost of mastering the songs, pressing the CDs, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The CDs will be manufactured by Austep Music, an environmentally-friendly music printing company.

I posted this in another sub, but wanted to share here as well. The more I've thought about it, the more I view it more as a female empowerment issue vs. just a sexual issue. I recently traded private messages with another female redditor in another sub and it made me realize I want to clarify and vocalize these thoughts. I can be a bit extreme/out there in my thoughts sometimes, so here goes.

I recently read a book by Wednesday Martin called ""Untrue."" It was very enlightening and eye opening, but made total sense in light of the events in my own life. It was about the traditional views of women's sexuality and how they are all wrong.  I won't really go into a lot of details about this, but the long and short is, I am married to a man, but about a year ago I started opening up my relationship sexually with a female friend (with his full knowledge). Here are my thoughts of some conclusions as to where my journey has led.

We all know sex is a very powerful force in the world, and while it is and can be a very wonderful thing, it has also been used by men since the dawn of time as a tool of oppression and evil. I know there have been multiple books and essays about how women can use sex to their advantage in the power struggle, and this has always bothered me. It implies that we need to use our bodies to be equals with men, whereas men do not have to do any such thing. Although I fully support exploring ways to equalize power, I do not support a method that requires something not required of men. I suggest something a bit different when it comes to utilizing our sexuality.

I do not speak for all women, but my experience has always been that there is something very different in my relationships with other women compared to those with men. It's not something I can put my finger on, but it is a closeness and an understanding/appreciation that is extremely difficult to attain with a man. The common pitfalls I've had in my male relationships of gaslighting, having the other person wonder ""did I do something"" when I'm just trying to express how I feel, and overall getting me just aren't nearly as prevalent in my female relationships. My closest, emotionally tender moments in life have been shared with my close female friends. I don't think I'm alone, but I would guess a large percentage of women have been in those moments, and there is a moment, even if only briefly, where the lines between friendship/kinship and the feelings of closeness experienced in a romantic/sexual relationship are blurred. In my own life, I have taken those feelings to the next step and allowed that friendship/kinship to progress into sexual expression. Forget labels for a moment. Whether we are bi, lesbian, straight, or identify in any other way, I truly believe that taking that next step into sexual expression is a very natural thing that is a natural extension of the close feelings and emotions in friendship between women.

I really think the only reason this doesn't occur more is because of the world we live in and the stigmas that have been created by a male dominated society. If we could wipe our programming clean, I think these types of connections would happen way more frequently between women, and absent any male involvement. Here is why I think this is important. We are the gatekeepers of sex with the men who have caused the problems (for purposes of this post, I am not referring to gay or bi men who too have been oppressed). If women had more frequent expression of sexual desire with other women, it would do two things:

1. It would take much of the power out of men's hands. We would decide when and how sex involved a man. If we chose to, we would. If not, we don't. But if we were satisfying our sexual desires with other women, that might be adequate for us and we would not have a reason to give in to the patriarchal bullshit that so often governs sex. It leads to a very significant shift in the power dynamic.
2. My experience has taught me that sex with another woman can be very empowering. It is so different in terms of how it effects self-image and confidence. It has changed the way I think about myself and by extension has changed how I interact in my public life. It has nullified some of the confidence and self image issues that I believe are a product of a patriarchal society. I truly believe it would do the same for other women.

I know what I am proposing seems very much out there, and would require a total rethinking of traditional relationships, but I wish more women felt comfortable with this. There is so much we go to our female friends for: affirmation, openness, understanding, etc....why can't sexuality be one of those things? It just seems to fit so naturally into the order of things. It would change so many things as well. I realize many will look at this and say ""But I'm straight, that wouldn't work for me."" I grew up thinking I was 100% straight. Until a little later in life, I didn't give desire for other women a second thought, but I truly believe it's something that would work for almost every woman out there. I think there is so much more this could lead to. It would only strengthen the bonds between women in many different aspects of our lives (personal, career, etc.) and when we are closer and together, we are in a much better position to change the world.",1558630550.0

The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the [LARGEST in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Venezuela), totaling 297 billion barrels.

While ignoring (and even supporting) the atrocities of authoritarian regimes in places like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Uzbekistan, US oligarchs have targeted Venezuela for “regime-change” in the name of “democracy”.

Currently, the US is engaging in economic warfare against Venezuela to foment a coup and remove its democratically elected president Nicolás Maduro.

Without providing solid evidence, our corporate-controlled government and mainstream media portray Maduro as a corrupt, repressive, and illegitimate leader with little to no support.

# Why is the US Corporatocracy so Keen to Remove Maduro?

While Venezuela’s economy is not a strictly-state-run economy, its oil industry is nationalized and uses its revenues for the benefit of its citizens (especially the poor).

After years of crippling US sanctions Maduro stepped over a crucial line in October when his government announced that Venezuela was abandoning the US dollar and would be make all future transactions on the Venezuelan exchange market in euro.

Saddam Hussein also went off the dollar in favor of the euro in 2003 – we started dropping bombs on him the next month.

A similar decision by the Gadhafi government in Libya (2011) was quickly followed by a devastating US-orchestrated conflict - culminating in Gadhafi's capture by radical Islamists who [sodomized him with a bayonet before killing him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUf6ypUz8LI).  Since then, Libya has gone from Africa's wealthiest country to a truly failed-state complete with a slave trade!  To make matters worse, after the collapse of the Libyan government, its military arms were smuggled out of that country and into the hands of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria - enabling US-orchestrated chaos in those countries.

# Who cares what currency a country uses to trade petroleum?

# Answer: US oligarchy

The US dollar is central to US world economic domination.

Like all other modern currencies, it is a fiat currency – backed by no real assets to prop up its value.

In lieu of a “gold standard” we know operate on a de-facto “oil-standard”:

""After the collapse of the Bretton Woods gold standard in the early 1970s, the United States struck a deal with Saudi Arabia to standardize oil prices in dollar terms. Through this deal, the petrodollar system was born, along with a paradigm shift away from pegged exchanged rates and gold-backed currencies to non-backed, floating rate regimes.

The petrodollar system elevated the U.S. dollar to the world's reserve currency and, through this status, the United States enjoys persistent trade deficits and is a global economic hegemony."" [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/072915/how-petrodollars-affect-us-dollar.asp)

“The central banking Ponzi scheme requires an ever-increasing base of demand and the immediate silencing of those who would threaten its existence. Perhaps that is what the hurry \[was\] in removing Gaddafi in particular and those who might have been sympathetic to his monetary idea.” [Anthony Wile](https://www.thedailybell.com/all-articles/editorials/anthony-wile-gaddafi-planned-gold-dinar-now-under-attack/)

# US Foreign Policy is about Oligarchy Not Democracy

Since World War II, [the US has attempted to over-throw the 52 foreign governments](https://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list).  Aside from a handful of exceptions (China, Cuba, Vietnam, etc.), the US has been successful in the vast majority of these attempts.

US foreign policy is not about democracy – it is about exploiting the world’s resources in the interests of a small, ultra-wealthy global elite.

This exploitation benefits a small percentage of people at the top of the economic pyramid while the costs are born by those at the bottom.

# US CIA Coup Playbook:

**How to Plunder Resources from Foreign Countries While Pretending to Support Democracy**

1. Find a country with resources you want.
2. Send in an “[Economic Hitman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuAct1BxHU)” to offer bribes the country’s leader in the form of personally lucrative business deals.  If he accepts the deal, the leader will amass a personal fortune in exchange for ""privatizing” the resources you wish to extract.

If the leader will not accept your bribes, begin the regime-change process.

3) Engage in economic warfare by imposing crippling sanctions on the country and blame the ensuing shortages on the leader’s “socialist” policies.

4) Work with right-wing allies inside country to fund and organize an “[astroturf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)” opposition group behind a corporate-friendly puppet.

5) Hire thugs inside country to incite unrest and violence against the government in coordination with your opposition group.   Use corporate media to publicize the orchestrated outbursts as popular outrage and paint a picture of a “failed state” mired in corruption and chaos.

6) When the government arrests your thugs, decry the response as the brutal repression.  Use corporate-owned media to demonize the target government as a despotic regime while praising your puppet opposition as champions of democracy.

7) Work with right-wing military leaders to organize the overthrow the government (offer them the same business deals the current leader refused).

8) If a military-led coup cannot be organized, create a mercenary army to carry out acts of terrorism against the government and its supporters.  Portray the mercenaries as “freedom fighters” and their acts of terrorism as a “civil war”.

9) If the target government has popular and military support and is too well-defended for your mercenaries to over-throw: label the country a “rouge state” and wait for the right time to invade.  Meanwhile, continue to wear the country’s government and populace down using steps 3 – 8.

10) Escalate the terror campaign within the country to provoke a military response from the country against the US.  If they won’t take the bait , fabricate an attack or threat that you can sell to the US population as justification for an invasion.

11) Once the government is removed, set up your puppet regime to provide the illusion of sovereignty.  The regime will facilitate and legitimize your appropriation of the country’s resources under the guise of ""free"" trade.

12) As you continue to extract the country’s resources, provide intelligence and military support to the puppet regime to suppress popular dissent within the country.

13) Use the demise of the former government as yet another example of the impracticality of “socialism.”

# [‘Venezuela’: Media’s One-Word Rebuttal to the Threat of Socialism](https://fair.org/home/venezuela-medias-one-word-rebuttal-to-the-threat-of-socialism/)

[ALAN MACLEOD](https://twitter.com/AlanRMacLeod) FEBRUARY 8, 2019

A recent Gallup poll ([8/13/18](https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx)) found that a majority of millennials view socialism favorably, preferring it to capitalism. Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders is the [most popular](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bernie-sanders-most-popular-politician-poll-trump-favorability-a7913306.html) politician in the United States, while new leftist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (AOC) policies of higher taxes on the wealthy, free healthcare and public college tuition are highly popular—even among Republican voters (FAIR.org,[1/23/19](https://fair.org/home/ocasio-cortez-rattles-pundits-across-the-corporate-media-spectrum/)).

Alarmed by the growing threat of progressive policies at home, the establishment has found a one-word weapon to deploy against the rising tide: Venezuela. The trick is to attack any political figure or movement even remotely on the left by claiming they wish to turn the country into a “socialist wasteland” (Fox News,[ 2/2/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/venezuela-is-the-socialist-wasteland-that-ocasio-cortez-and-fellow-democrats-are-leading-the-u-s-toward)) run by a corrupt dictatorship, leaving its people hungry and devastated.

Leading the charge have been Fox News and other conservative outlets. One Fox opinion piece ([1/25/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dan-bongino-hey-ocasio-cortez-sanders-venezuelas-socialism-has-been-a-disaster-what-say-you)) claimed that Americans should be “absolutely disgusted” by the “fraud” of Bernie Sanders and Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, as they “continue to promote a system that is causing mass starvation and the collapse of a country,” warning that is exactly what their failed socialist policies would bring to the US. (Back in the real world, while Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez identify as socialists, Warren is a self-described [capitalist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-02/why-elizabeth-warren-still-calls-herself-a-capitalist), and Booker is noted for his ties to Wall Street, whose support for his presidential bid he has reportedly been [soliciting](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/wall-street-and-new-york-business-execs-gear-up-for-2020-presidential-election-.html).) A second Fox Newsarticle ([1/27/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-now-pushing-many-of-the-same-socialist-policies-that-destroyed-venezuela)) continues in the same vein, warning that, “At the heart of Venezuela’s collapse is a laundry list of socialist policies that have decimated its economy.”

*The* *Wall Street Journal* *(*[*1/28/19*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/socialists-of-the-world-unite-11548722544)*) describes calls for negotiations in Venezuela as “siding with the dictator.”*

In an article entitled “Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn and the Starving Children of Venezuela,” the Washington Examiner ([6/15/17](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/bernie-sanders-jeremy-corbyn-and-the-starving-children-of-venezuela)) warned its readers to “beware the socialist utopia,” describing it as a dystopia where children go hungry thanks to socialism. The Wall Street Journal ([1/28/19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/socialists-of-the-world-unite-11548722544)) recently condemned Sanders for his support of a “dictator,” despite the fact Bernie has [strongly criticized](http://inthesetimes.com/article/21697/democrats-president-donald-trump-coup-venezuela-juan-guaido-nicolas-maduro) Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and dismissed Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, as a “dead Communist dictator” (Reuters,[ 6/1/16](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-usa/venezuelas-maduro-rooting-for-revolutionary-friend-sanders-in-u-s-campaign-idUSKCN0YN32Q)).

More supposedly centrist publications have continued this line of attack. The New York Times’ Bret Stephens ([1/25/19](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/venezuela-maduro-socialism-government.html)) argued: “Venezuela is a socialist catastrophe. In the age of AOC, the lesson must be learned again”—namely, that “socialism never works,” as “20 years of socialism” has led to “the ruin of a nation.” The Miami Herald([2/1/19](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article225431885.html)) cast shame on Sanders and AOC for arguing for socialism in the face of such overwhelming evidence against it, describing the left’s refusal to back self-appointed president **Juan Guaidó, someone whom** [**less than 20 percent**](https://www.thenation.com/article/venezuela-coup-guaido-maduro/) **of Venezuelans had even heard of**, let alone voted for, as “morally repugnant.”

**This useful weapon to be used against the left can only be sustained by withholding a great number of key facts—chief among them, the US role in Venezuela’s devastation. US sanctions, according to the Venezuelan opposition’s economics czar, are responsible for a halving of the country’s oil output (FAIR.org, 12/17/18). The UN Human Rights Council has formally condemned the US and discussed reparations to be paid, with one UN special rapporteur describing Trump’s sanctions as a possible “crime against humanity” (London Independent, 1/26/19). This has not been reported by any the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN or any other national US “resistance” news outlet, which have been only too quick to support Trump’s regime change plans (FAIR.org, 1/25/19).**

**Likewise, the local US-backed opposition’s role in the economic crisis is barely mentioned. The opposition, which controls much of the country’s food supply, has officially accepted responsibility for conducting an “economic war” by withholding food and other key goods.**

**For example, the monolithic Empresas Polar controls the majority of the flour production and distribution crucial for making arepa cornbread, Venezuela’s staple food. Polar’s chair is Leopoldo Lopez, national coordinator of Juan Guaidó’s Popular Will party, while its president is Lorenzo Mendoza, who considered running for president against Maduro in the 2018 elections that caused pandemonium in the media (FAIR.org, 5/23/18).**

**Conspicuously, it’s the products that Polar has a near-monopoly in that are often in shortest supply. This is hardly a secret, but never mentioned in the copious stories (CNN, 5/14/14, Bloomberg, 3/16/17, Washington Post, 5/22/17, NPR, 4/7/17) focusing on bread lines in the country.**

**Also rarely commented on was the fact that multiple international election observer missions declared the 2018 elections free and fair, and that Venezuelan government spending as a proportion of GDP (often considered a barometer of socialism) is actually lower than the US’s, and far lower than most of Europe’s, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation.**

*The London* *Daily Express* *(*[*2/3/19*](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1081839/labour-news-jeremy-corbyn-jo-cox-venezuela)*) demonstrates that redbaiting works equally well on either side of the Atlantic.*

Regardless of these bothersome facts, the media has continued to present Venezuela’s supposedly socialist dictatorship as solely responsible for its crisis as a warning to any progressives who get the wrong idea. So useful is this tool that it is being used to attack progressive movements around the world. The Daily Express ([2/3/19](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1081839/labour-news-jeremy-corbyn-jo-cox-venezuela)) and Daily Mail ([2/3/19](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6662757/Corbyn-allies-rally-round-Labour-leader-Venezuelas-socialist-president-Maduro.html)) condemned UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for his “defense” of a “dictator,” while the Daily Telegraph([2/3/19](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/02/03/venezuela-labours-blueprint-britain/)) warned that the catastrophe of Venezuela is Labour’s blueprint for Britain. Meanwhile, the Greek leftist party Syriza’s support for Maduro (the official position of [three-quarters](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14303) of UN member states) was condemned as “shameful” (London Independent, [1/29/19](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-us-sanctions-alexis-tsipras-greece-support-a8751771.html)).

“Venezuela” is also used as a one-word response to shut down debate and counter any progressive idea or thought. While the panel on ABC’s The View ([7/23/18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW32S19vp0k)) discussed progressive legislation like Medicare for All and immigration reform, conservative regular Meghan McCain responding by invoking Venezuela: “They’re starving to death” she explained, leaving the other panelists bemused.

President Trump has also used it. In response to criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren over his “Pocahontas” jibe, he replied that she would “make our country into Venezuela” (Reuters,[ 10/15/18](https://reuters.com/video/2018/10/15/warren-would-destroy-the-country-trump?videoId=473661112&videoChannel=1003)).

The weapon’s effectiveness can only be sustained through a media in lockstep with the government’s regime-change goals. That the media is fixated on the travails of a relatively small and unimportant country in America’s “backyard,” and that the picture of Venezuela is so shallow, is not a mistake. Rather, the simplistic narrative of a socialist dictatorship starving its own people provides great utility as a weapon for the establishment to beat back the domestic “threat” of socialism, by associating movements and figures such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jeremy Corbyn with an evil caricature they have carefully crafted.

# Corporate Propaganda Blitz Against Venezuela’s Elected President: MSM Will Not Let Facts Interfere With Coup Agenda

[Facts Don’t Interfere With Propaganda Blitz Against Venezuela’s Elected President](https://fair.org/home/facts-dont-interfere-with-propaganda-blitz-against-venezuelas-elected-president/)  [Joe Emersberger](https://fair.org/author/joe/)

**Guaidó, anointed by Trump and a new Iraq-style Coalition of the Willing, did not even run in Venezuela’s May 2018 presidential election. In fact, shortly before the election, Guaidó was not even mentioned by the opposition-aligned pollster Datanálisis when it published approval ratings of various prominent opposition leaders. Henri Falcón, who actually did run in the election (defying US threats against him) was claimed by the pollster to basically be in a statistical tie for most popular among them. It is remarkable to see the Western media dismiss this election as “fraudulent,” without even attempting to show that it was “stolen“ from Falcón. Perhaps that’s because it so clearly wasn’t stolen.**

**Graph: Approval Ratings of Main Venezuelan Leaders Nov 2016 - July 2018 Data from the opposition-aligned pollsters in Venezuela (via Torino Capital) indicates that Henri Falcón was the most popular of the major opposition figures at the time of the May 2018 presidential election. Nicolás Maduro won the election due to widespread opposition boycotting and votes drawn by another opposition candidate, Javier Bertucci.**

**The constitutional argument that Trump and his accomplices have used to “recognize” Guaidó rests on the preposterous claim that Maduro has “abandoned” the presidency by soundly beating Falcón in the election. Caracas-based journalist Lucas Koerner took apart that argument in more detail.**

What about the McClatchy-owned Miami Herald's claim that Maduro “continues to reject international aid”? In November 2018, following a [public appeal](https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/14147) by Maduro, the UN did authorize emergency aid for Venezuela. It was even reported by Reuters ([11/26/18](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-un/u-n-approves-9-million-in-aid-for-crisis-stricken-venezuela-idUSKCN1NV2AR)), whose headlines have often broadcast the [news agency’s contempt](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-imports-exclusive/exclusive-as-venezuelans-suffer-maduro-buys-foreign-oil-to-subsidize-cuba-idUSKCN1IG1TO) for Maduro’s government.

It’s not unusual for Western media to ignore facts they have themselves reported when a major “[propaganda blitz](http://www.medialens.org/index.php/alerts/alert-archive/2019/893-venezuela-blitz-part-2-press-freedom-sanctions-and-oil.html)” by Washington is underway against a government. For example, it was generally reported accurately in 1998 that UN weapons inspectors were withdrawn from Iraq ahead of air strikes ordered by Bill Clinton, not expelled by Iraq’s government. But by 2002, it became a staple of pro-war propaganda that Iraq had expelled weapons inspectors (Extra! Update, [10/02](https://fair.org/extra/what-a-difference-four-years-makes/)).

And, incidentally, when a Venezuelan NGO requested aid from the UN-linked Global Fund in 2017, it was [turned down](https://plataformalac.org/en/2017/02/global-fund-denies-humanitarian-support-to-hiv-people-of-venezuela/). Setting aside how effective foreign aid is at all (the [example of Haiti](https://haitiliberte.com/the-oxfam-sex-scandal-the-role-of-ngos-today-journalist-kim-ives-speaks-with-sharmini-peries-of-the-real-news-network/) hardly makes a great case for it), it is supposed to be distributed based on relative need, not based on how badly the US government wants somebody overthrown.

But **the potential for “aid” to alleviate Venezuela’s crisis is negligible compared to the destructive impact of US economic sanctions.** Near the end of the Miami Herald article, author Jim Wyss cited an estimate from the thoroughly demonized Venezuelan government that US sanctions have cost it $30 billion, with no time period specified for that estimate. Again, this calls to mind the run-up to the Iraq invasion, when completely factual statements that [Iraq had no WMDs](https://fair.org/take-action/media-advisories/star-witness-on-iraq-said-weapons-were-destroyed/) were attributed to the discredited Iraqi government. Quoting Iraqi denials supposedly balanced the lies spread in the media by US officials like John Bolton, who now leads the charge to overthrow Maduro. Wyss could have cited economists independent of the Maduro government on the impact of US sanctions—like US economist [Mark Weisbrot](https://therealnews.com/stories/new-oil-sanctions-on-venezuela-would-destroy-whats-left-of-its-economy), or the emphatically anti-Maduro Venezuelan economist [Francisco Rodríguez](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/12/why-more-sanctions-wont-help-venezuela/).

**Illegal US sanctions were first imposed in 2015 under a fraudulent “state of emergency” declared by Obama, and subsequently extended by Trump. The revenue lost to Venezuela’s government due to US economic sanctions since August 2017, when the impact became very easy to quantify, is by now** [**well over $6 billion**](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14073)**. That’s enormous in an economy that was only able to import about $11 billion of goods in 2018, and needs about $2 billion per year in medicines. Trump’s “recognition” of Guaidó as “interim president” was the pretext for making the already devastating sanctions much worse. Last month, Francisco Rodríguez revised his projection for the change in Venezuela’s real GDP in 2019, from an 11 percent contraction to 26 percent, after the intensified sanctions were announced.**

**The $20 million in US “aid” that Wyss is outraged Maduro won’t let in is a rounding error compared to the billions already lost from Trump’s sanctions.**

Former US Ambassador to Venezuela William Brownfield, who pressed for more sanctions on Venezuela, dispensed with the standard “humanitarian” cover that US officials have offered for them (**Intercept**, [2/10/19](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/10/intercepted-podcast-vijay-prashad-venezuela-india/)):

>And if we can do something that will bring that end quicker, we probably should do it, but we should do it understanding that it’s going to have an impact on millions and millions of people who are already having great difficulty finding enough to eat, getting themselves cured when they get sick, or finding clothes to put on their children before they go off to school. We don’t get to do this and pretend as though it has no impact there. We have to make the hard decision—the desired outcome justifies this fairly severe punishment.

How does this gruesome candor get missed by reporters like Wyss, and go unreported in his article?

**Speaking of “severe punishment,” if the names John Bolton and Elliott Abrams don’t immediately call to mind the punishment they should be receiving for crimes against humanity, it illustrates how well the Western propaganda system functions. Bolton, a prime facilitator of the Iraq War,** [**recently suggested**](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/02/01/yiiiiikes-john-bolton-threatens-send-venezuelas-maduro-offshore-us-prison-guantanamo) **that Maduro could be sent to a US-run torture camp in Cuba. Abrams played a key role in** [**keeping US support flowing**](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/1/30/allan_nairn_trump_s_venezuela_envoy) **to mass murderers and torturers in Central America during the 1980s. Also significant that Abrams, brought in by Trump to help oust Maduro, used “humanitarian aid”** [**as cover to supply weapons**](https://twitter.com/kgosztola/status/1091848921771638785) **to the US-backed Contra terrorists in Nicaragua.**

In the Miami Herald article, the use of US “aid” for military purposes is presented as another allegation made by the vilified Venezuelan president: “Maduro has repeatedly said the aid is cover for a military invasion and has ordered his armed forces not to let it in, even as food and medicine shortages sweep the country.”

[**Venezuela Accuses U.S. of Secretly Shipping Arms After Weapons Found on Plane with Possible CIA Ties | Democracy Now!**](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/2/13/venezuela_accuses_us_of_secretly_shipping)

**Calling for international aid and being** [**democratically elected**](https://www.mintpressnews.com/when-is-a-democracy-not-a-democracy-when-its-venezuela-and-the-us-is-pushing-regime-change/254321/) **will do as little to protect Maduro’s government from US aggression as being disarmed of WMD did to prevent Iraq from being invaded—unless there is much more pushback from the US public against a lethal propaganda system.**

**Suggested Reading:**

Until that is understood by enough people, the Trump administration will continue to devastate Venezuela’s economy with illegal sanctions and push it towards civil war.

Come join us and let's get noticed! Here are some tips on how you can help:

Follow the Facebook page The TERF Exhibit - Public, or the Twitter @terf_the to access the 80+ #IwascalledTERF submissions. They will be posting them throughout the afternoon. You can also post your own, or simply type your #IwascalledTERF story into your own social media account and tag them.

Their goal for today is exposure and attempted media attention. This means that The TERF Exhibit will be tagging various news, organizations, bloggers, public figures, scientists, speakers, etc. Help them do this if you can. On Twitter, tag the people you want to see this, or who you want held accountable for accepting this politic. 

Use a targeted strategy if and where you can. If you're posting a submission about lesbianism, tag ""LGBT"" organizations and bloggers. If you're posting a submission about biological reality, tag a scientist! You get the drift.

You can also go google ""popular news organizations"" and pick some of the places that have high traffic.

Target BOTH people who agree and disagree with us. Use your cleverness to help bring visibility and media attention to The TERF Exhibit. That's the goal.

From Facebook to Policebook (Boston Indie) 2 Feb 2018,Liberal,3,7yyn8b,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/7yyn8b/from_facebook_to_policebook_boston_indie_2_feb/,1,"From Facebook to Policebook 2 February 2018

On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a notice outlining extraordinary plans by the social media company to monitor all the postings and messages of its users, censor independent journalism, and use artificial intelligence (AI) to report users to the police and intelligence agencies.

Zuckerberg began his post, released in conjunction with the company's quarterly earnings report, by declaring that 2017 was a ""hard year"" for Facebook. ""The world feels anxious and divided--and that played out on Facebook. We've seen abuse on our platform, including interference from nation states, the spread of news that is false, sensational and polarizing, and debate about the utility of social media."" Facebook, he writes, has the responsibility to ""amplify the good and prevent harm. That is my personal challenge for 2018.""

In Facebook's ""newspeak,"" this means that the company will act aggressively this year to suppress the spread of information online and censor content, under the guise of combatting ""fake news"" and ""Russian meddling.""

The truly ominous implications of this project are outlined in Zuckerberg's post. Among Facebook's initiatives, he writes, is ""new technology to detect suicidal posts that has helped first responders reach more than 100 people who needed help quickly, and we've built AI systems to flag suspicious behavior around elections in real time and remove terrorist content.""

In other words, Facebook has introduced AI systems to collect, monitor and interpret all the information posted on its social media platform. As always, the introduction of such a sweeping system of mass surveillance is justified with seemingly praiseworthy motivations. After all, who could object to measures aimed at stopping suicides or terrorist attacks? The actual purpose of the new systems, however, is very different.

Zuckerberg points to the sweeping scope of the company's artificial intelligence plans later: ""Our goal with AI is to understand the meaning of all the content on Facebook."" Every single post, photo, video, message, comment, reaction and share will be fed into the company's increasingly powerful computer systems to be analyzed for ""harmful"" content, and reported to the police and intelligence agencies as deemed necessary.

The real--and sinister--aim of Facebook's actions is also made clear by the other initiatives that the company is taking. Most significantly, Zuckerberg stressed the company's determination to make sure that ""the information you see on Facebook comes from broadly trusted and high-quality sources, in order to counter misinformation and polarization.""

What are these ""broadly trusted"" sources? ""For example, take the Wall Street Journal or New York Times,"" wrote the multibillionaire CEO. ""Even if you don't read them or don't agree with everything they write, most people have confidence that they're high quality journalism. On the flip side, there are blogs that have intense followings but are not widely trusted beyond their core audience. We will show those publications somewhat less.""

In other words, corporate media sources will be promoted, while other publications, even those that ""have intense followings,"" will be demoted. As for being ""shown somewhat less,"" what Zuckerberg means is that they will be blocked from reaching a broader audience. More simply, they will be censored.

In addition to censoring news from alternative sources, Zuckerberg states at the beginning of his post that Facebook is working to ""show fewer viral videos"" because such content is not ""good for people's well-being and for society.""

The viral videos Zuckerberg is referring to include footage of police violence, social exposures like reporting on last year's Grenfell Tower inferno that exposed social inequality in London, and documentation of the war crimes carried out by the US military. Any such content will be ""demoted,"" which Zuckerberg later notes ""reduces an article's traffic by 80 percent.""

Zuckerberg's central pretense--that Facebook will promote sources that ""people have confidence"" in--is a fraud. In fact, according to a Gallup poll published last year, Americans' trust in the mass media ""to report the news fully, accurately and fairly"" reached its lowest level in poling history, with only 32 percent of participants saying they have a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of trust. At the same time, the use of social media to read news has been growing exponentially, reaching two-thirds of the US population according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.

The growth in the popularity of Facebook and other social media networks was in large measure due to the fact that they allowed their users access to information and viewpoints unavailable through mainstream media outlets. Now, Facebook has reversed course and declared that its intention is to promote the official narrative and block independent news sources that question it.

Facebook, Google, Twitter and other giant social media companies--working closely with intelligence agencies and governments--are seeking to leverage their role as mechanisms of communication to become instruments of censorship and repression. In the process, they are turning one of the most important and liberating technological advances of the 21st century, the growth and expansion of artificial intelligence, into a mechanism for police control and dictatorship.

The fight against Internet censorship is an urgent task facing workers all over the world. The World Socialist Web Site is leading the fight against the greatest threat to free speech since the Second World War. On January 23, it published an open letter calling for an international coalition of socialist, antiwar, left-wing and progressive websites, organizations and activists to fight Internet censorship.

The principles for this coalition are:

• Safeguarding the Internet as a platform for political organization and the free exchange of information, culture and diverse viewpoints, guided by the principle that access to the Internet is a right and must be free and equally available for all.

• Uncompromising insistence on the complete independence of the Internet from control by governments and private corporations.

• Unconditional defense of net neutrality and free, unfettered and equal access to the Internet.

• The banning and illegalization of government and corporate manipulation of search algorithms and procedures, including the use of human evaluators, that restrict and block public visibility of websites.

• Irreconcilable opposition to the use of the Internet and artificial intelligence technologies to carry out surveillance of web users.

• Demanding the end to the persecution of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden and the complete restoration of their personal freedom.

• Advocating the transformation of the corporate Internet monopolies into public utilities, under internationally coordinated democratic control, to provide the highest quality service, not private profit.

• The fight against Internet censorship and the defense of democratic rights cannot be conducted through appeals to capitalist governments and the parties and politicians who serve their interests, but only in uncompromising struggle against them. Moreover, this struggle is international in scope and totally opposed to every form and manifestation of national chauvinism, racism and imperialist militarism. Therefore, those who are truly committed to the defense of democratic rights must direct their efforts to the mobilization of the working class of all countries.

Falling US life expectancy: Product of deliberate ruling class policy (Boston Indie) 9 February 2018,Liberal,1,7yycul,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/7yycul/falling_us_life_expectancy_product_of_deliberate/,0,"Falling US life expectancy: The product of a deliberate ruling class policy 9 February 2018

An editorial in a British medical journal has focused renewed attention on the shocking reality that life expectancy in the United States is declining. ""Failing health of the United States: The role of challenging life conditions and the policies behind them,"" published Wednesday in BMJ, formerly the British Medical Journal, builds on reports in December by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that revealed US life expectancy declined in 2016 for the second year in a row.

The editorial's authors, Steven H. Woolf and Laudan Aron, both sat on a joint panel of the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine in 2013 that investigated US health disadvantage compared to other member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). According to World Bank Data, the average life expectancy of an aggregate of 35 OECD countries stood at about 75.5 years in 1995. By 2015 the rate had risen to 80.3 years, while the US lagged behind at 78.7 years.

The editorial points to the myriad diseases and behaviors contributing to decreased lifespans in America, as well as to the social and economic factors driving them. The picture emerging is one of a society wracked by burgeoning social inequality, a catastrophic health crisis, and a government health policy aimed at deliberately lowering life expectancy while catering to corporate profit.

The opioid epidemic, alcohol abuse and suicides are leading causes of death in the US. The rate of fatal drug overdoses rose by 137 percent from 2000 to 2014. In 2015 alone, more than 64,000 people died from drug overdoses, exceeding the number of US fatal casualties in the Vietnam War. The suicide rate rose by a staggering 24 percent between 1999 and 2014.

These ""deaths of despair"" have disproportionately affected white Americans, including adults aged 25-59, those with limited education, and women. The sharpest increases have been in rural areas.

As to why the rise in mortality has been greatest among white, middle-aged adults and some rural communities, the editorial points to possible factors, which all relate to class issues. They include ""the collapse of industries and the local economies they supported, the erosion of social cohesion and greater social isolation, economic hardship, and distress among white workers over losing the security their parents once enjoyed.""

The 2013 panel found that ""Americans had poorer health in many domains, including birth outcomes, injuries, homicides, adolescent pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease."" It found that Americans are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as intake of high-calorie foods, drug abuse and firearm ownership.

The editorial also notes that such behaviors are linked to ""weaker social welfare supports and lack of universal health insurance."" What does this mean in the lives of workers and their families? It means cuts to food stamps and cash welfare assistance, the shutdown of community clinics and scarcity of substance abuse programs, lack of health insurance and/or burdensome medical bills. All these factors contribute to poor health outcomes and premature deaths.

Falling life expectancy--one of the most important measures of the social health of a society--has elicited no response from any faction of the US political establishment, neither the Trump administration nor the Democratic Party. On Thursday evening, the US Senate was deliberating on a two-year budget agreement that would increase military spending by $305 billion.

At his weekly press conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that the main factor contributing to the government's increasing deficit is not the Pentagon's gargantuan budget, which funds the US military's aggression around the globe, but the so-called entitlements--Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--programs that workers depend on for their retirement and their families' health.

As the Democratic Party continues its obsession with claims of Russian meddling in the 2018 US elections, the Trump administration has pursued its assault on social programs. After failing in numerous attempts to repeal and/or replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the White House repealed the ACA's individual mandate as part of the corporate tax overhaul, and has allowed states to begin imposing work requirements for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and the disabled.

Discussion of health care and the well-being of American workers has become a non-issue for the Democrats, as they have emerged as the most adamant representatives of the military-intelligence agencies, supporting an impending war against Russia--in opposition to Trump and the Republicans and their saber-rattling against North Korea.

In reality, the war against the health of American workers has been a bipartisan conspiracy conducted over decades as part of a conscious strategy to pare back the gains won through the social struggles of the working class begun over a century ago.

Under the Obama administration, the implementation of the ACA was a key volley in the ruling elite's social counterrevolution in health care. Sold as an expansion of health care, it was in fact aimed at limiting and rationing workers' access to vital medical treatments and medicines as ""unnecessary"" and ""lavish."" At the same time, through the universal mandate, it required individuals and families to purchase coverage from private health insurers under threat of tax penalties.

Both the Democrats and Republicans bemoan the high cost of health care in America. But the reality is that the high cost of health care--Americans pay on average $10,000 per person, per year--is not the result of actual spending on health care for workers and their families for vital treatments. It is because the US leaves the vast majority of pricing for drugs, procedures and hospital stays in the hands of the private sector. While hospitals and drug companies charge outrageous prices, millions of people remain uninsured and untreated.

For the ruling class, the increasing number of deaths of working men, women and youth is a ""cost of doing business."" Indeed, it is seen as a positive good, as early deaths mean fewer costs associated with caring for the elderly--and more resources to pump into the stock market.

The US health care crisis is a national emergency. The ruling classes of the world, moreover, look to the US as a model for their own ruthless assault on jobs and social programs. To address this crisis requires a frontal assault on the wealth of the corporate and financial elite.

The socialists call for the expropriation of the wealth of the corporate and financial aristocracy, and the transformation of the giant drug and health care corporations into public utilities, run on the basis of social need. The vast resources currently monopolized by the top one percent must be made available to finance a universal health care system, in which everyone has access to high-quality care as a basic social right.

Such a social and economic reorganization requires the building of a mass movement of the working class, in opposition to both Democrats and Republicans, uniting workers of all races and nationalities in a fight against the capitalist profit system.

Workers Vanguard No. 1127 9 February 2018

Their Monuments and Ours

(Letter)

4 January 2018

Dear WV,

In response to the article “Confederate Monuments: Tear ’Em All Down!” (WV 1113) I think it appropriate to note an example of the working class tearing down a monument representing interests antithetical to the workers’ own. The example I had in mind was the destruction of Napoleon’s Victory Column, decreed by the Paris Commune in 1871, while under the guns of both Prussian and Bonapartist armies, as a symbol of national chauvinism and an incitement to national hatred...attitudes unworthy of the Commune in relation to workers of all other countries. [All ellipses by author.]

The Paris Commune, with its establishment of the first Workers’ Republic, had a profound effect on the American bourgeoisie.

This event, among others, led many of America’s Northern bourgeoisie to re-think the wisdom of experiments in remaking southern society and using the Federal army to defend Reconstruction governments and black rights to achieve that end.

Making peace with their Southern bourgeois partners suddenly made a lot more sense, after the Commune, even if it meant abandoning the black population to race-caste status, enforced by systematic violence perpetrated by the forbears of today’s Fascists.

Make no mistake about what the Fascists’ “celebration” of those who fought to keep black people in chains means today.

Auschwitz and Dachau, Belsen and Birkenau, celebrated not in stone but, once again, in reality, is the ultimate monument the Fascists hope to enforce on humanity.

A victorious workers’ state would celebrate its own victory, by contrast, with monuments appropriate to its aim of liberating humanity from the scourge of capitalism and its Fascist dogs of war, by honoring all those who won a crucial initial victory in the still ongoing battle to Finish The Civil War....

One hundred and fifty years ago today’s Fascist forbears were beaten by a black and white army, significantly made up of southerners, ex-slaves, free blacks and the foreign born, receiving critical political support from workers in other countries.

Seventy-five years ago another generation of Fascists were crushed by the might of the Red Army, defending the Soviet degenerated workers’ state.

Today’s Fascists will be defeated by the mobilization of all their intended victims behind the power of the working class, strategically placed in capitalist class society, and the only class with the social power, organization and interest to smash the Fascist threat, here and internationally, as part of its fight to take power in its own name and create an International Soviet.

This program is expressed in the ICL’s call for labor black united front mobilizations to smash the Fascists and its power expressed in a series of successful anti-Fascist mobilizations in the US and one in Rouen, France.

We fully honor the sacrifice of all those who fought against or were victims of Fascist terror only by mobilizing the power to stop the Fascist scum in their tracks, so we do not have to keep adding names like Heather Heyer to the list of the lost and we can, instead, stuff the physical and ideological expression of Fascism down deep in the trash bin of history where it belongs, and where it will stay, with the victory of Socialism internationally over decaying capitalism and the filth it degrades human life with.

Fraternally, Gordon W.

"Australian Imperialist Torture in the Pacific - Full Citizenship Rights for Manus, Nauru Refugees! (Australasian Spartacist)",Liberal,1,7yxy3h,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/7yxy3h/australian_imperialist_torture_in_the_pacific/,0,"https://archive.is/cyZvt

Australasian Spartacist No. 233 Summer 2017/18

Australian Imperialist Torture in the Pacific

Full Citizenship Rights for Manus, Nauru Refugees!

In late November, Papua New Guinea (PNG) Navy officers and police stormed the recently closed Australian-operated Manus Island Detention Centre (MIDC), viciously beating refugee protesters who had refused to leave. Many were injured in the attack as police confiscated their phones, destroyed their few possessions and herded them onto buses for transportation to “alternative accommodation” in Lorengau, a small town on the remote, malaria-infested PNG island. Hundreds of refugees were relocated to the Lorengau camp, which is widely recognised as being unfit for human habitation. On top of the wretched living conditions, the refugees also fear for their safety following confrontations with and threats of violence by some within the small, mainly Melanesian local community.

The forcible removal of refugees followed a three-week stand-off in which refugees courageously refused Australian government demands that they accept “relocation.” The centre was formally closed on 31 October following a PNG Supreme Court ruling last year that the facility was illegal because it denied asylum seekers their liberty.

At the beginning of November electricity, running water, medicine and regular food supplies were cut off at the MIDC. PNG authorities also destroyed makeshift water catchments and threatened locals who assisted the refugees. Crammed into rooms and tents in unbearable heat and suffering from starvation, dehydration and the increasing threat of disease, the exhausted refugees demanded freedom in a safe environment. In response, the Australian Liberal/National Coalition government waged a systematic campaign of vilification, lies and cover-up. The stone-cold racist immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said that claims of violence against the protesters were “inaccurate and exaggerated.” Prime Minister Turnbull cheerily hailed the forced removal of the men to Lorengau.

Outrageously during the stand-off Turnbull rejected New Zealand's (NZ) offer to resettle 150 refugees because, he said, it would encourage “people smugglers."" While criticising Turnbull for not accepting the NZ offer, Labor leader Bill Shorten made it crystal clear where the ALP stands, declaring “Australia is not and must not be a resettlement option.”

The lives of refugees, many of whom have fled countries devastated by blood-drenched wars waged by the U.S. and Australian imperialism, are of no consequence to the bourgeois statesmen and women who inhabit the Australian parliament. Labor and Liberal/National Coalition governments alike have been eager to oversee jackal Australian imperialism’s part in the subjugation and exploitation of millions across Asia the Middle East and beyond. Today’s reactionary “border protection” regime is an integral part of Australia’s decades-long role as a bastion of white, capitalist privilege and junior partner to U.S. imperialism in Asia and the Pacific. Degrading and tormenting refugees serves a purpose—to whip up poisonous nationalism through which the bourgeois rulers strive to instil loyalty, if not submission, to the state and compact the population behind their racist and exploitative class rule. In opposition to the government’s racist immigration laws we demand all refugees be released. Close the detention camps! No deportations! Full citizenship rights for all who have made it here, including those on Manus Island and Nauru!

Bipartisan Racist Oppression

The Manus Island refugees’ heroic resistance sparked solidarity protests across the country and drew international attention to Australia's barbaric treatment of refugees. Under the current Australian government’s “Operation Sovereign Borders,” asylum seekers who come by boat are considered “illegal.” Denied the right to set foot in Australia, they are intercepted on the ocean by Australian naval forces and turned back towards Indonesia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Meanwhile, those captured on the high seas and transported to islands outside of Australian territory (for example under the previous Labor government’s “Pacific Solution Mark II”), remain imprisoned indefinitely in squalid camps on Manus Island and Nauru. Under threat of deportation back to the countries they fled—where they can face imprisonment and/or death—these refugees are stripped of any rights. Many have existed in these camps in a Guantánamo-style twilight zone for years.

The Australian government has spent $10 billion in the last three years alone persecuting these desperate people. Families have been ripped apart. Reports of sexual abuse and assaults on women and children are suppressed. Physical and psychological torture by guards and medical neglect are the norm. There are epidemic rates of depression, self-harm and attempted suicide. Six men have died at the MIDC. Last year a young Iranian refugee, Omid Masoumali, died in a Brisbane hospital after he set himself alight on Nauru.

Things are hardly better for those refugees incarcerated in the notoriously brutal compounds in Australia, such as Sydney’s Villawood Detention Centre. Nor for the tens of thousands on the temporary bridging visa E, judged to have been in Australia “unlawfully” and awaiting the outcome of refugee claims. Many cannot access healthcare or legally work. Living as an under-class on the fringes of society they are subject to a draconian and punitive “code of behaviour,” which exists over and above the legal system. One bridging visa holder has been incarcerated for more than two years for drinking a beer on a train. Meanwhile, the government recently stripped all welfare and housing support from asylum seekers who had been transferred to Australia for medical reasons. Labelled a “burden” on the welfare system, these people were also placed on bridging visa E for deportation.

The government's abuse of refugees follows the deeply racist traditions of Australian capitalism. From the bloody destruction of Aboriginal populations, to the exclusionary White Australia policy, to colonial domination in the Pacific, the Australian capitalist rulers have an unbroken record of brutal racist terror. The ALP is the historic party of White Australia par excellence. In 1992, mandatory detention was first implemented by the Keating Labor government. Since then, vying for the racist vote, successive Liberal/National Coalition and Labor governments have enforced ever more insular, repressive and blatantly racist immigration policies.

Imperialist Destruction in the Region

The Australian capitalist rulers’ use of their Nauru and PNG neocolonies as dumping grounds for refugees, in exchange for financial handouts to their cash-poor regimes, throws a sharp light on Australia’s sordid role in the region. At the beginning of the 20th century the tiny island of Nauru had massive deposits of phosphate, a valuable commodity used for fertiliser. Following World War I (WWI) Nauru fell under British rule and was jointly administered by New Zealand and Australia. The island’s phosphate was aggressively strip-mined and shipped mainly to Australia. When the reserves were exhausted Nauru was left as little more than a jagged moonscape unsuitable for any form of agriculture or even recreation. At the point of independence in 1968, the island was deemed uninhabitable. Eventually the economy collapsed. Today the population suffers extreme levels of diabetes and heart disease and Nauru is a dependent “client state” of Australia.

Australia’s role in PNG has been no less destructive. In 1884, Germany annexed the northern parts of New Guinea and Britain claimed the southern parts. Australia took over British New Guinea in 1906. Its army occupied German New Guinea during WWI and took control of all of New Guinea following the war. Thereafter Papuans were to suffer racist Australian “protection”: they were deprived of rights, subject to forced labour and forbidden to travel outside the country, especially to Australia. Following World War II, having “pacified” the country by punitive expeditions, massacres and the burning of villages, a thin layer of white planters, police, administrators and the feared Kiap (patrol officers) enforced a brutal regime of indentured servitude in the mines and copra plantations. BHP’s huge Ok Tedi gold and copper mine was run on apartheid lines.

Following PNG independence in 1975, Australian capitalism continued to dominate the country as a neocolonial overseer as large Australian mining companies, such as BHP, plundered the country’s resources while trashing the environment. To protect these fabulous profits and put down labour unrest and landowner protests, PNG police have been funded and trained by Australia. In 1989, the giant Australian-owned Panguna copper mine on the PNG island of Bougainville was shut down when independence fighters began waging a guerrilla war. In the ensuing seven-year conflict up to 20,000 Bougainvilleans died due to a crippling blockade and PNG police and military actions, all of which were directly brain-trusted, financed and armed by Canberra. PNG state forces continue to carry out brutal repression, such as the shooting last year of PNG students protesting government corruption. It is these same Australian-backed PNG state forces who have repeatedly assaulted refugees. Last April PNG defence personnel stormed the MIDC, firing bullets at buildings housing refugees.

Touching Faith in the Capitalist State

Aiming to silence criticism and stymie pro-refugee sentiment, in 2015 the government passed the Australian Border Force Act. Under this law, any staff member within the offshore detention system who speaks out about conditions in the camps is liable to two years in prison. The government has also attempted to enforce a media blackout. Despite the chilling impact of these measures, many continue to defy the Act. For example, in June 2016, psychologist Paul Stevenson stated that in 40 years working with the victims of terrorist attacks and natural disasters, the conditions in Australia’s offshore camps were the worst “atrocity” he had seen.

By savagely punishing desperate asylum seekers the bourgeoisie aims to inure working people to the idea that loss of rights and horrific treatment, particularly for brown, dark-skinned and other non-European derived people, is the norm. At the same time they hone police-state measures, to be used against social struggles at home. Indeed, demonstrations across the country in solidarity with the Manus Island protesters have been increasingly met with a heavy police presence. Ominously a protest in Melbourne was attacked by fascists, and then by the cops, leaving at least one protester bloodied. The government’s relentless anti-refugee attacks and anti-Muslim “war on terror” have emboldened all manner of racist and fascist forces. Fascists pose a deadly danger to the workers movement and all the oppressed. They must be stopped by determined contingents of the organised working class, alongside all the fascists’ intended victims. This would be a step along the road to sweeping away the capitalist system that spawns this deadly menace.

It is a good thing that thousands have come out to solidarise with refugees. The main demands of the recent protests raised by various reformist groups such as Solidarity, Socialist Alternative (SAlt) and Socialist Alliance (SA) have been “Close the Camps” and ""Bring them here!"" Conspicuously absent have been demands for full citizenship rights for all who have made it here. This is no accident. Above all these reformists craft their demands to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the hope of attracting the church goers and small ‘l’ liberals who have come out in large numbers to protest. Unsurprisingly, the whole thrust of the demonstrations thus far have been to channel anger into futile appeals on the government and Labor “Opposition” to act on behalf of refugees while seeking to pressure the small bourgeois Greens party to the left. Most open in this regard is Solidarity who are key players within the Refugee Action Coalition (RAC).

Solidarity and other reformist groups have for years called for a vote to the Greens in federal elections. In every demonstration, Solidarity and the other reformists who inhabit RAC provide the Greens with a platform, and without criticism, to posture as bona fide defenders of refugees. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Greens uphold the capitalist system, including defending the borders of Australia. Their main concern about the mistreatment of refugees is that it may discredit Australian imperialism on the international stage, particularly in the Asia-Pacific. Lest there be any doubt, it was the Greens who propped up the Gillard-Rudd minority Labor government of 2010-13, even after it introduced its draconian offshore processing regime and re-opened the Nauru and Manus Island centres.

Promoting the illusion of a kinder, fairer capitalist state, in 2009 SAlt, SA and the Socialist Party (SP) signed a statement that called for refugees to be allowed to “live in freedom in Australia while their claims are processed.” The wretched SP continue to raise a qualitatively similar demand today. Thus on bended knees these reformists accept that the racist capitalist state should have the power to decide who, among those already living here, is not to be “accepted.”

Such touching faith in the capitalist state was sharply revealed two years ago when these same left groups came out in support of strikes by the Australian Border Force (ABF). Along with the police, military, and prisons, immigration officers form part of the armed fist of the state, which exists to suppress the working class and anyone who challenges the bourgeoisie's rule. The ABF enforces the bosses’ racist immigration laws, including by patrolling air and seaports and carrying out deportations and onshore detention. Support to ABF strikes is consistent with the reformist view that the capitalist state can be made to serve the interests of the workers and oppressed. However, Marxists know that any hard-fought defence of workers’ rights, and the rights of the oppressed, will face the repressive apparatus of the capitalist state.

Successful “strikes” for better conditions for border force, screws and cops simply mean they are better armed to repress the struggles of workers and minorities. In embracing customs and immigration officers as union brothers the reformist left are tailing and covering for the pro-capitalist union tops who organise these and other state forces into the unions. In contrast we seek to bring to the working class the understanding that it must organise independently of the bourgeoisie and its state. In sharp political opposition to the current misleaders and their left tails, class-struggle militants in the unions would seek to mobilise the proletariat to oust the cops, screws, immigration officers and security guards from the unions.

We Need a Multiracial Revolutionary Workers Party

Capitalists around the world, including Australia, are slashing jobs and carrying out anti-union attacks. Anti-immigrant racism divides the working class in the face of capitalist attacks and must be fought by the organised workers movement. Workers must be won to the understanding that they share a common class interest with the workers of all countries and all nationalities against the capitalist class enemy. Mobilising the workers movement in defence of refugees and immigrant rights is crucial to defending the multiracial working class, which needs unity in struggle to fight the bosses.

The main obstacle to such a program is the ALP-loyal, sell-out trade-union leadership, who propagate the nationalist lie that there can be a unity of interests between workers and the capitalist rulers who get rich by exploiting workers’ labour power. While unions such as the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) have joined protests in defence of refugees and previously stated their opposition to mandatory detention, offshore processing and deportations, the leadership pushes vile protectionism, demanding ""Aussie resources, local jobs,"" and helps promote anti-immigrant hysteria by giving support to the government's ""border protection"" measures.

In opposition to nationalist Laborism we seek to build a multiracial revolutionary workers party like the Bolshevik Party led by V.I. Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Such a party would act as a tribune of the people, taking up the struggle against every manifestation of capitalist oppression. In contrast to the reformist left, we Marxists do not seek to advise capitalist governments on more “progressive” immigration policies. All immigration laws in defence of the nationally-based bourgeoisie’s rule are necessarily racist and chauvinist. Our perspective as Marxists is to build a party that can mobilise the multiracial working class in struggle against all of the government's racist immigration laws. The fight for full citizenship rights for all who have made it here is part of the struggle to sweep away the brutal rule of capitalism. It will take a series of socialist revolutions around the world to open the road to the construction of classless, egalitarian societies based on material abundance where all will be able to live free from oppression. For a workers republic of Australia, part of a socialist Asia!

Workers Vanguard No. 1125 12 January 2018

Mexico: Earthquakes and Capitalist Criminal Negligence

The following article has been translated from Espartaco No. 48 (December 2017), which is published by the Grupo Espartaquista de México, section of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist).

Again on September 19, this time at 1:14 p.m., a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the center of Mexico. At the time, the anniversary of the earthquake that devastated Mexico City in 1985 and left an estimated 20,000 dead and 100,000 homeless was being commemorated. It would appear to be calculated cruelty: the new earthquake struck a little over two hours after a national disaster drill took place. Barely 12 days earlier, an even more powerful 8.2 magnitude earthquake had rocked [the states of] Oaxaca and Chiapas.

In Mexico City, scenes from 1985 were replayed. On one hand were the terror and dismay of the population, millions of whom were scarred for life by the 1985 tragedy. On the other hand, thousands of youth and workers voluntarily mobilized to begin rescue work and gather and distribute food and tools. A contingent of Central American immigrants on their way to the U.S. border stopped in Oaxaca to offer help, risking deportation, while the Cuban deformed workers state sent a brigade of doctors, despite its scarcity of resources and the hostility of [Mexican president Enrique] Peña Nieto (a lackey of yanqui imperialism).

Even if the scale of this tragedy was not close to that of 1985, according to official figures the recent earthquakes left 471 people dead, mainly in Mexico City, where 228 died. Eighty-three people died in Oaxaca and 74 in Morelos state. Although the disaster in Mexico City’s exclusive Roma and Condesa neighborhoods dominated the news, poor areas in the south of the capital were practically devastated, as were impoverished towns in Oaxaca, Morelos, Chiapas and Puebla. Hundreds of thousands of Mexico City inhabitants were left without potable water. According to the Secretary of the Interior, 2.3 million people were left homeless in Oaxaca and Chiapas. But it isn’t nature that should be blamed as centrally responsible for the loss of human lives—it’s the capitalist system, which necessarily generates class inequality and subordinates the very lives of the poor to the production of profits.

When the bourgeoisie and its government speak of “natural disasters,” they are simply trying to cover up the criminal negligence and priorities of the capitalist system. Some of the collapsed buildings in the capital were poorly built multifamily residential buildings intended to house workers’ families; other buildings had been opened only a few months before they caved in. In rural and semi-rural areas, many of the homes that collapsed had been built or expanded by workers or peasants on their own, with whatever materials they could afford and with scant structural planning.

The earthquakes exposed a small part of the enormous web of corruption connected to the unfettered real estate speculation that unites all levels of the government, the capitalist parties (the PRI [ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party], the PAN [right-wing National Action Party], the PRD [nationalist-populist Party of the Democratic Revolution], Morena [Movement for National Regeneration, a split from the PRD], etc.) and private consortiums. Between 2000 and 2012, under federal PAN governments some seven million homes of “social interest” (for the poor) were built, the bulk of which are simply uninhabitable—rinky-dink dumps in remote housing developments lacking any services, prone to fire and likely to collapse with the wind and rain.

A handful of capitalists have augmented their already massive fortunes through these schemes, which involve Wall Street and imperialist institutions like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (see “Mexico’s Housing Debacle,” Los Angeles Times, 26 November 2017). At the bottom of society, due to extremely onerous mortgages, hundreds of thousands of working-class families have lost everything or are trapped in these unsanitary ghettos. Almost 150 years ago, Friedrich Engels, who together with Karl Marx founded scientific socialism, taught us that “the housing shortage is no accident; it is a necessary institution and it can be abolished together with all its effects on health, etc., only if the whole social order from which it springs is fundamentally refashioned” (The Housing Question, 1872).

Criminal Exploiters

The bourgeois media now speak of “solidarity” in an insulting campaign of flag-waving schmaltz. But the earthquakes showed, once again, the ineptitude, insatiable search for profit and disregard for human life and suffering on the part of the capitalist class, its state and its entire system. The 1985 earthquake brought to light the inhuman situation of industrial textile workers, especially women, when in the very center of the city almost 1,600 workers died. They were without a union, were paid miserable wages and were crammed into improvised workshops in rickety buildings packed with heavy machinery. Now, in the miserable Obrera neighborhood, a building collapsed that housed a dressmaking workshop and other businesses. To date, it’s not clear how many workers perished, given that in most cases textile workers lack any legal benefits, and thus there is no reliable count of the workforce.

The September 19 Seamstresses Union was born out of the 1985 catastrophe. Today it has been practically destroyed due to attacks by the government and the bourgeoisie. Mexican workers organizations have been the target of an incessant offensive by the bosses since the 1980s, in the face of which the bulk of the trade-union bureaucracies have simply ducked for cover. In 1985, unions like the SME electrical workers, which was destroyed in 2009 by the PAN’s [Felipe] Calderón, and the miners and steel workers mobilized to carry out rescue work. But this time the battered organizations of the working class were absent. The extensive solidarity that was displayed lacked the discipline, experience, skill and class content that only the workers movement could provide.

It is necessary to revitalize and strengthen the unions by organizing the masses of workers that do not have union representation. The existing union leaderships are without exception pro-capitalist bureaucracies that tie workers to one or another bourgeois party and inculcate in the working class the notion that the capitalist state is everlasting. To unchain the proletariat’s enormous social power, a struggle is needed to replace these bureaucracies with class-struggle leaderships committed to mobilizing the working class in the interest of all the exploited and oppressed.

Bourgeois State to the “Rescue”

With medical and rescue services overwhelmed, authorities asked the population for donations of everything from water, milk and tools to adrenaline. The shelters that were improvised were often unsanitary and exposed to inclement weather, especially in the countryside. At least a large part of the food and necessary supplies for the homeless came from the population. These donations were the object of innumerable cases of corruption by the government and bourgeois parties.

In this ever more militarized society, the government’s only plan when faced with disaster situations is the mass mobilization of the forces of the capitalist state (the army, the navy, the police); firemen, paramedics and other rescue services barely exist. While the military may have participated in rescue efforts, the overwhelming majority of soldiers and navy men do not have the slightest training for such tasks: their job is to repress. In fact, while there was no shortage of assault rifles, the detachments of soldiers lacked shovels, pickaxes and any basic tool for removing rubble in search of trapped survivors. The police, meanwhile, are the guard dogs of the bourgeoisie, plain and simple.

The bourgeois state is a machine of coercion directed against the exploited and oppressed at the service of the capitalists and their regime. In that vein, a central purpose of the state forces was to intimidate the population and protect private property from “looting,” i.e., desperate people procuring necessary consumables. The real looters are the capitalists, who squeeze out of the workers their very last drop of sweat and blood! Just as in 1985, the cuerpo de granaderos [riot police] soon cordoned off disaster areas to contain the indignation and rage of residents, who still did not know the fate of their relatives and friends when the government decided to end rescue efforts and bring in heavy machinery.

“Reconstruction” and Bourgeois Philanthropy

Oozing elitism, PRI president Peña Nieto, with Miguel Mancera of the PRD (head of the Mexico City government) at his side, announced with great fanfare that he would grant the capital’s homeless 3,000 pesos [approximately $160] a month to pay rent for up to three months—an amount barely enough to pay for a room. Owners of collapsed homes in the city will receive mortgage credits of up to two million pesos [$105,000] for 20 years at 9 percent annual interest. Those who lost everything, maybe even their families, can now acquire one more debt with the capitalist government and bloodsucking banks.

Peasants in Oaxaca and Chiapas were promised 120,000 pesos if their homes were destroyed and 15,000 if they only suffered “partial damage.” In Chiapas alone, almost 17,000 homes collapsed. The racist Peña Nieto sermonized that with the money, people should have enough to build “decent and dignified two-room” homes, as long as they don’t spend it on something else. This was an allusion to the vile stereotype of indigenous people spending all their money on alcohol.

Having promised 120,000 pesos, the cruel government reconsidered. Since a good number of homes still had a wall standing, such damage was in the end considered “partial.” So the government deducted 105,000 pesos from those affected. In any case, many of the homeless in the southeast have protested that they haven’t received a single peso, since they were given bankcards without funds.

The same builders who, hand-in-hand with the government, are centrally responsible for the tragedy will now make a killing from reconstruction, including of Catholic churches, which will be paid for out of public funds. However, in a display of Christian compunction, the “private initiative” (the bosses) donated four billion pesos, and the Vatican gave alms of $150,000 (not enough to rebuild even one of the lavish churches). That kind-hearted soul Carlos Slim [telecom magnate] “raised” 2.3 billion pesos, money that was “donated” basically by hundreds of thousands of people paying the monopolistic phone charges that allowed him to become one of the world’s richest men. Sweet philanthropy! As Engels wrote of the bourgeois philanthropic hypocrites in 19th-century England:

“As though you rendered the proletarians a service in first sucking out their very life-blood and then practicing your self-complacent, Pharisaic philanthropy upon them, placing yourselves before the world as mighty benefactors of humanity when you give back to the plundered victims the hundredth part of what belongs to them! Charity which degrades him who gives more than him who takes; charity which treads the downtrodden still deeper in the dust, which demands that the degraded, the pariah cast out by society, shall first surrender the last that remains to him, his very claim to manhood, shall first beg for mercy before your mercy deigns to press, in the shape of an alms, the brand of degradation upon his brow.”

—The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845)

No Illusions in the Capitalist Parties!

Now that the child has drowned, they want to cover the well. Facing popular pressure, [Andrés Manuel] López Obrador (AMLO) and his Morena promised to donate a little more than 100 million pesos for the homeless. The other capitalist parties will also donate part of the millions they get in subsidies to those affected by the earthquake, even though they, along with government authorities, had originally met the proposal with indignation. In the face of growing discontent, López Obrador wants to offer a little more carrot without easing up on the stick. AMLO is a bourgeois populist committed to the capitalist order—he and his Morena are no less enemies of proletarian victory than are the PRI, PAN and PRD.

AMLO bases his whole 2018 presidential campaign on rhetoric against the “corruption” of the “mafia in power.” But corruption is inevitable under capitalism. And don’t forget, it was successive PRD Mexico City governments—starting with López Obrador in 2000, when he was still in the PRD—that unleashed real estate speculation. Criminal corruption around permits and supervision of construction in the city occurred for the most part under its PRD governments, as well as borough administrations under Morena (in Cuauhtémoc, Tláhuac and Xochimilco) and the PAN (in Benito Juárez).

There is without a doubt disgust and anger at the capitalist rulers among the Mexican masses. After September 19, Secretary of the Interior Osorio Chong and municipal president Avelino Méndez Rangel of Morena confirmed this for themselves when they had to haul ass to save their hides from the fury of residents of Obrera and Xochimilco respectively. But what is missing is a class understanding. The masses’ miserable situation, as well as the rulers’ disdain for human welfare, are not the products of the policies of one or another party or individual, but rather are inevitable characteristics of the capitalist system based on private ownership of the means of production.

For a Workers and Peasants Government!

Half of this country is in an area of intense seismic activity, and practically the entire coastline is under the annual threat of hurricanes. In Mexico City, one of the most populous cities in the world, danger from earthquakes is increased by the fact that a large part of it is built on a lakebed. Scientific institutions as well as the government were fully aware that a new and potentially catastrophic earthquake was just a matter of time. Though earthquakes, like other natural phenomena, are unpredictable, technology exists that can give the population some advance warning, depending on the distance from the epicenter. But preventing disasters is far from capitalism’s priority. In this society everything, including science, is subordinated to the enrichment of a handful. The agency responsible for the famous (and most often inaudible) seismic alert system is a private entity, an obscure civil association called CIRES, that offers early-warning systems for more than 50,000 pesos. And Mexico City’s supposedly strict anti-earthquake construction standards are worth nothing when making money is involved.

Incapable of providing everyone with safety, health care, decent housing and employment, capitalism deserves to perish. Against the bourgeoisie’s speculation and fraud, in order to reconstruct disaster zones and tackle unemployment, we are for an extensive plan of public works and housing improvement under union control—let the workers themselves ensure the quality of materials and construction—and for a sliding scale of wages and work hours. A struggle for goals like these would light the way toward the necessary revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. A workers and peasants government—the dictatorship of the proletariat supported by the peasantry—would put science at the service of society, which would at least help minimize the effects of natural disasters.

Faced with rural misery, workers are forced to cram into cities in search of some way to survive, living in rooms as dismal as they are expensive and often lacking basic services. As a basic and immediate way to begin solving the housing problem, a workers state would expropriate the opulent residences of the possessing classes and open them to workers who are homeless or in overcrowded housing. We communists work to see the day when the true producers of society’s wealth occupy the mansions and luxury apartments of the Polanco and Las Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhoods…and the presidential residence at Los Pinos!

Workers and peasants in power would fight to overcome the contradiction between the city and the countryside. Such a regime would seek to eliminate ancestral rural backwardness by bringing all of modern society’s advances to the countryside: decent, comfortable housing; roads; schools; telecommunications; industry and scientific agriculture; etc. As a result, a huge, chaotic, overpopulated, dirty, polluted city like Mexico City, which is sinking and collapsing, could gradually be eliminated.

This perspective is not realizable without the international extension of the revolution, especially to advanced countries like the U.S. and other powers, which would put enormous resources inherited from imperialist capitalism at the service of the world’s vast dispossessed and oppressed masses. It is necessary to forge Leninist-Trotskyist parties, following the example and experience of the Bolsheviks who brought the Russian workers and peasants to power in 1917. Such parties would fight for socialist revolutions internationally to destroy capitalism and set the foundations for a new society, where those who labor rule, on the basis of the collectivization of the means of production. Humanity’s struggle against blind nature requires the expropriation of the capitalist expropriators and the establishment of an international planned economy dedicated to satisfying human needs.

(Part One can be found here - https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersVanguard2/comments/7fnh2s/in_defense_of_marxism_and_science_1_of_2/?st=jagwzd99&sh=365299f2 )

A striking case in point is given by the late Stephen Jay Gould in his book The Mismeasure of Man. He recounts the story of American physician Samuel George Morton, who had collected some 600 skulls representing populations on the continents of North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Morton measured the cranial volume of the skulls (a good measure of the brain size of the person when alive) and published his results, including the original data. Just as Morton would have expected, Anglo-Saxons had the highest average (92 cubic inches), followed by Asians in the middle and blacks on the bottom (83 cu in). When Gould re-analyzed Morton’s data he found biases built into the specimens used for each racial group. For example, the aboriginal sample was heavily represented by skulls from Peruvian people who are short. Similarly, the black sample included proportionally more women than the Caucasian. Smaller bodies means smaller brain mass—it has nothing to do with intelligence, and should have been corrected (but wasn’t). As Gould noted, this was done “without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action.”

In medicine today, researchers use the double-blind randomized clinical trial to eliminate such subjective biases from influencing the results. Double-blind means that both the study subjects and those providing the treatment do not know whether any particular patient is receiving the actual medicine or a sham control. Blinding the patients by randomization helps correct for the placebo effect—people want to be cured or get some relief from illness or pain and will respond just to the soothing voice of a caregiver or to a sugar pill (especially if brightly colored!). Blinding the caregiver prevents unconscious cues being given to the patient that would allow the latter to guess that they are receiving real treatment rather than the control.

Medical Quackery

It is true that what is now called science-based medicine is rather a recent innovation. Voltaire is credited with the aphorism, “Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of which they know nothing.” In 1891, the writer and physician Oliver Wendell Holmes acidly noted that if most of the drugs then in use were loaded on a ship and if it “could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes.”

Times do change, and procedures such as MRI or CT scans which are routine today would have seemed like science fiction a generation or two ago. As advances have been made in physics and chemistry, and especially molecular biology, they have dramatically affected the practice of medicine. Yet the popularity of “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) is great and rising. Many people can’t afford regular medical care, and patients will grasp at anything that promises a cure. I.e., CAM is a social problem.

What is alternative medicine? There are lots of definitions, but at bottom it is the same division that separates science from non-science. Real medicine is based on substances or procedures whose efficacy can be explained by purely natural causes. All the rest depends on something non-physical, be it divine intervention (prayer healing) or the invocation of some mysterious “energy” or “life force” outside the laws of physics. Medicine is real and the rest is faith-based, not unlike religion, though at times without the guy in the sky.

Buzzwords like “energy” and “life force,” which are at the heart of all alternative medicine nostrums, are really nothing but a cover for the idea of “vitalism”—i.e., that there is something unique about living systems. This was scientific mainstream until the 1820s when German chemist Friedrich Wöhler accidentally synthesized urea from inorganic compounds. This was the first time a molecule previously only obtained from living organisms had been created in the laboratory, and it marked the birth of organic chemistry. Actually the division of chemistry into organic and inorganic is itself a vestige of the vitalist era. The laws governing chemical reactions are the same.

Edzard Ernst, an MD and also practitioner of CAM, and Simon Singh, a British science journalist, have written a useful book, Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine. If anything the authors bend over backwards to give CAM the widest latitude to show proof of some shred of benefit beyond the placebo effect. And what is the conclusion? Acupuncture and homeopathy: useless; chiropractic: maybe you could try it but only for lower back pain, though a physical therapist would be just as good, and cheaper; herbal medicines: a few have a mildly positive effect, but in most cases conventional drugs work as well or better.

So why is CAM still around? Here are 33.9 billion reasons: that is the number of dollars Americans spent out-of-pocket on alternative medicines in 2007, according to the National Institute of Health’s alternative medicine center. This does not even include charges to insurance. Out of that, about $15 billion went for supplements—that’s about one third of the out-of-pocket expenses for real prescription drugs. One possible reason is the odd belief that nature is this kind, gentle, holistic entity that has only your best interests at heart. This shows a profound ignorance of the natural world. I would suggest that those so believing pick up a good book on human parasitology, preferably with good color pictures!

Chiropractic Pseudoscience

I’ll pick on chiropractic. These guys not only fleece you but can cause great damage in the process. Chiropractic started in the 1890s when one Daniel David Palmer came up with the idea that diseases were caused by misalignments of the vertebrae that interfered with the flow of “innate intelligence” from the nervous system to the organs. These disruptions were called subluxations. Was this on the basis of systematic investigations of any kind? No. Palmer’s epiphany came one day when he claimed to have cured a person with hearing problems by adjusting his spine. One slight problem is that the cranial nerves controlling hearing and balance go directly from the lower brain to the middle ear—they do not emanate from the spinal cord at all. As for the “innate intelligence,” not a shred of physical proof has ever been given for its existence.

Chiropractors perform what they call manipulation to cure the subluxations in the vertebral column. This is a rapid acceleration thrust on the bone which moves it just past the point where muscles could conceivably move it on their own, but short of bone and tissue damage. Well, that’s the theory. For my book, it sounds more like what happens to your spine in an automobile accident. When applied to the cervical vertebrae—the seven vertebrae of the spinal column in your neck—the results can be vertebral arterial dissection. This can obstruct blood flow to the brain or throw a clot that leads to a stroke.

Chiropractors, like all purveyors of “alternative medicine,” like to portray themselves as little Davids struggling against the Goliaths of Big Pharma and the American Medical Association. But chiropractors pull in almost $4 billion a year—it’s a business, just like Big Pharma. Chiropractor Web sites are full of handy tips on “practice building”—roping in more patients, preferably for weekly or biweekly office visits. Even if you are well, they want you to get an adjustment—like a tune-up, I guess. Even cars only need an oil change every 6,000 miles, not every week!

Religious Obscurantism

Now we come to the granddaddy of all quackery: religion. I’m going to concentrate on the Christian fundamentalists, in particular the very political anti-science, anti-evolution movement now masquerading as Intelligent Design (ID). All three of the so-called Abrahamic faiths share a common creation myth. God created everything, and all the animals and plants have come from that creation pretty much unchanged. Some of the anti-evolution types allow for a bit of change within a species, but no speciation. So, it was no surprise that Darwin’s book was met with such hostility by the believers of theism: God was removed as the causative agent for the wonderful variety of living things, and man was an animal like the rest and descended from primate ancestors. And what the yahoos couldn’t stomach at all was Darwin’s speculation—now backed by overwhelming evidence—that the human ancestor had come out of Africa.

Intelligent Design is a relatively recent sprout on the Christian bush. Actually, it is an example of rapid speciation into a new environment. Prior to 1987, the creationists were touting “creation science” and demanding that it be taught in the public schools alongside evolution. That got shot down by a series of court decisions, starting with an Arkansas case in 1982, and then in the Supreme Court in 1987. So rather quickly—no evolution here!—“creation science” transformed itself into “intelligent design.”

Intelligent Design pretends that it is scientific, but its basic premises are very wrong and it is important to see why. Premise one is “irreducible complexity”—there exist things in nature like the eye, or with a nod to nanotech, cellular assemblages such as the bacterial flagellar motor. According to ID, such things have to be taken as a whole, with every part essential to function—remove one piece and it is non-functional. Supposedly there is no step-by-step way of building these structures, i.e., no Darwinian method. Since they are so complex, they couldn’t have come about by chance and therefore had to have been created by a Designer. They’re careful not to say God, but it’s pretty clear they are not referring to the Tooth Fairy.

In the Origin of Species, Darwin anticipated such problems, including the example of the vertebrate eye, and the creationists love to quote his sentence: “To suppose that the eye…could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.” But they never mention his answer in the very next sentence of the passage: “If any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.” Think about it: would you rather have blurred vision, or be totally blind? Even an imperfect eye gives an organism a selective advantage compared with no sight at all.

The second premise is the Anthropic Principle. There is such vastness to the universe. There is the beautiful, intricate motion of the planets around the Sun, moons around the planets, of the stars and the galaxies—they now agree with Copernicus and Galileo—and here is Earth, just right for living things to exist on. If the Earth were closer to the Sun it would be too hot—look at Venus. Further away and it would be too cold. It looks like the whole universe was created or fine-tuned with human life in mind, so to speak. Hence, there must have been a Creator. Sir John Polkinghorne, a respected British physicist and also a Christian minister, stated: “The fundamental parameters of the universe are such as to permit the creation of observers within it.”

Sounds profound, right? But physicist Robert L. Park translated Polkinghorne into something less pretentious, more along the lines of what Yogi Berra might have said: “If things were different, things would not be the way things are.” There is another amusing argument put forward by the late author Douglas Adams, who, among other things, wrote the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and was a script editor for the famous British series Doctor Who in 1979. He compared the Anthropic Principle to a “puddle waking up one morning and thinking, ‘This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn’t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!’”

Of course the whole geological record shows that the Earth is much older than 6,000 years, and that thousands of species have come and gone over the ages. Creationists used to wail on about the lack of transitional forms for whales—how could a terrestrial mammal smoothly evolve into one now at home only in the oceans? Well, in the last 15 or so years, a whole string of fossils have been discovered showing in beautiful detail all those “missing forms.” In any case, the creationists aren’t about to let facts get in the way. Henry Morris, founder of the modern creationist movement, stated: “No geological difficulties, real or imagined, can be allowed to take precedence over the clear statements and necessary inferences of Scripture.”

While the creationists may seem fringe oddballs (comedian Lewis Black described them as the people who are “watching The Flintstones as if it were a documentary”), they are very political and they have supporters with deep pockets. In 1998, the Discovery Institute, a major think tank for creationism/ID, produced an internal memo called the “Wedge Document.” It was called that because they considered their attack on Darwin and evolution as the “thin edge of the wedge” for their broader “Governing Goals”: “to defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies” and “to replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.”

Science and Communist Liberation

Human evolution happened in such a way that no hominid ancestor survived; it could have been otherwise but wasn’t. All humans are genetically members of the same species and there is no biological basis for the separation into races. It should be noted that Darwin was a staunch abolitionist, and during the U.S. Civil War hoped that the North would put emancipation on its banner and eliminate slavery no matter the cost in blood. As we wrote in “Hail Charles Darwin!” (WV No. 854, 16 September 2005):

“America’s other peculiarity among advanced capitalist countries is its deeply religious character. Nowhere else—not even in Italy where the Vatican still heavily influences civil society—is there such refractory religiosity and visceral hostility to the long-established facts of Darwinian natural selection as the motor force of evolution. Why? The absence of even a mass reformist workers party that expresses in even a blurry way that working people have needs and interests counterposed to those of their exploiters is a large part of the explanation for political backwardness in the U.S. But like everything else in this country, it also boils down to the central intersection of race and class. Religion in the U.S. supplies an ideology that can seemingly harmonize conflicting class interests while keeping this society with two races firmly ordered: capital above labor and white above black.”

Liberals worry about the denigration of science and rationalism—how is the country to maintain a competitive position in the world if the next generation knows more about the Book of Numbers than about algebra? Marxists are materialists and take it as a given that science and religion are incompatible.

Here we come to the fundamental difference between Marxists and liberals. At bottom, liberals accept the existence of the capitalist order and their most radical demand is for reforms. Their high point was the French Revolution—liberty, fraternity, equality. All abstract ideals, behind which lurk the sanctity of private property and the class rule of the bourgeoisie. Liberals, it is true, will recognize the class struggle, but what they reject is that the proletariat should actually seize state power from the bourgeoisie.

The “liberty” so beloved by a capitalist is his liberty to make a profit, which necessarily comes through the exploitation of the workers he employs. Such exploitation is built into the capitalist system, a system that is at bottom irrational. Economic competition inevitably leads to military competition, and imperialist war. Imperialism can’t be reformed—the whole system of private property has to be overthrown. The goal of the Marxists is the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which on a global scale can lay the basis for a classless communist society.

Science can open up as yet undreamt possibilities for humanity. But under capitalism today, vast resources devoted to research are for military purposes. The American ruling class was the first to own and so far the only one to use nuclear weapons, and the warheads in the U.S. arsenal are now each 20 or more times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Even a “limited” nuclear war could have catastrophic consequences, beyond the initial effects of the explosions. Climactic changes could wreak havoc on key agricultural areas, putting the survival of the human species at risk.

The imperialists have to be removed from power and disarmed by the workers before the rulers kill us all. That will require building a revolutionary workers party, independent of all the parties of capital, including the Democrats. Obama has continued to carry on all the essential policies of the administrations before him. That is actually why the bourgeoisie put him in power. The whole racist, murderous edifice of American imperialism has to be smashed by the multiracial working class, organized into democratically elected councils and led by its Leninist-Trotskyist vanguard party.

As this talk has been in defense of Marxism and science, it is worth noting Marx’s words at the end of the preface to the first German edition of Capital: “The present society is no solid crystal, but an organism capable of change, and is constantly changing.” This dialectical mode of thought inspired Lenin, Trotsky and the whole Bolshevik Party that made the October Revolution in Russia in 1917. It remained a cornerstone of Trotsky’s thinking until the day he died.

In The Prophet Unarmed (1959) Marxist historian Isaac Deutscher cites a revealing sample of Trotsky’s vision of a future society, after capitalism’s demise: “The drudgery of feeding and bringing up children…will be lifted from the individual family by social initiative…. Woman will at last emerge from semi-slavery…. Socio-educational experiments…will evolve with a now inconceivable elan. The communist way of life will not grow up blindly like coral reefs in the sea. It will be built consciously. It will be checked by critical thought. It will be directed and corrected…. No sooner will one crust begin to form itself on the human existence than it will burst under the pressure of new inventions and achievements.”

The men and women of the future will no longer need religion, what Marx described as solace, the “opium of the people.” And the key to unlock human potential will be science, not superstition.

Workers Vanguard No. 971 7 January 2011

In Defense of Marxism and Science

When the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace went to present a copy of his treatise on celestial mechanics to Napoleon, the latter is said to have stated: “M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.” Laplace replied, “I had no need for that hypothesis.”

Two centuries later, any American politician caught on tape saying something like that would never be able to run for dogcatcher, let alone the Senate or presidency. The U.S. is peculiar among the advanced industrial countries in its level of religiosity—over three-fourths of respondents in an AP poll said they believed in angels. Worse still is an increase in the rejection of scientific thinking, from the millions seeking miracle cures from a panoply of snake-oil vendors to a politically cohesive and dangerous sector of religious fundamentalists out to turn the U.S. into a theocracy. I am not referring to the demented followers of Osama bin Laden. I am speaking of the Christian right, which has abortion and evolution as focus points of attack.

In the Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels state: “The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.” Well, we have a ruling class that could be described as drunk with power. The collapse of Stalinism in East Europe and the Soviet Union in 1989-92 was a world-historic defeat for the working class of the world. The American bourgeoisie declared the “death of Communism,” and even the “end of history.” With military power far greater than any of their imperialist rivals in Europe or Japan, the U.S. rulers have acted with little restraint on their predatory desires, as in Iraq and Afghanistan and recently in Haiti.

At the same time, the consciousness of the proletariat has been thrown back so far that even advanced workers and others involved in social struggle no longer identify their goal as building a socialist society. In the U.S. in particular, there is the question of race: black oppression is the bedrock of American capitalism; the notion of black people as being inferior, which survives to this day, was the ideological counterpart to black chattel slavery. America is if anything more segregated than 25 years ago.

Especially since the September 11 attacks, the “war on terror” has been used to beat the working class into submission and squelch opposition to the predations of U.S. imperialism across the globe. It is not just the linguistically challenged George W. Bush—Obama was made Commander-in-Chief in part to give the image of U.S. imperialism a needed facelift. But smoother words have not changed American military rampaging in Iraq and Afghanistan, nor the extension of police-state measures at home. The American ruling class sees no reason why it cannot continue to literally get away with murder.

In these circumstances it is no wonder that religious reaction is ascendant and even the rationalism of the Enlightenment of the 18th century is under attack. You don’t have to be a Marxist to oppose things like creationism, but without a Marxist program you have no way out of the impasse in which society finds itself. Society is rent by class struggle, legal and extralegal, as the bourgeoisie seeks ever greater profit from the exploitation of labor and workers resist. As Marx showed, there is a fundamental contradiction between the private ownership of the means of production and the further advance of productive forces. The rule of capital must be smashed by the working class, organized and led by a revolutionary Trotskyist party.

Part of the process of building that party is to educate the proletariat as to its historic role and responsibility for the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. That means a Marxist understanding of society, and that in turn means an understanding of the work of science and its defense against the purveyors of mystical and medieval rubbish. So first we have to review a bit of history.

The Middle Ages and Renaissance

The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 to the birth of Leonardo da Vinci in 1452 (or the victorious siege of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks a year later) marked about a thousand years. That’s about one-fifth of the entire history of human civilization since the first example of writing (the cuneiform tablets of southern Mesopotamia from about 3000 BC). In West Europe this period is called the Middle or Dark Ages. Not coincidentally, the dominant political and economic institution in this period was the Roman Catholic church. Along with the nobility, the church was a major landowner. The vast majority of the population was made up of serfs tied to the land of their lord, to whom they owed service as a feudal obligation. Illiterate, disease-ridden, all but slaves to their temporal and spiritual masters, the peasant masses faced, to quote Thomas Hobbes, “continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short” (Leviathan [1651]).

The Renaissance, which began in the city-states of northern Italy and was spurred by the growth of trade with the East, helped engender a new class of merchants, later to become the bourgeoisie of modern capitalism. As these merchants’ ships went further out into the world, they needed better knowledge on the workings of the natural world and the cosmos. In his 1883 Introduction to Dialectics of Nature, Engels succinctly notes:

“The main work in the first period of natural science that now opened lay in mastering the material immediately at hand. In most fields a start had to be made from the very beginning. Antiquity had bequeathed Euclid and the Ptolemaic solar system; the Arabs had left behind the decimal notation, the beginnings of algebra, the modern numerals, and alchemy; the Christian Middle Ages nothing at all.”

The church dogma on what we would call astronomy was what Ptolemy wrote in the second century AD. In his system, the Earth formed the center of motion, around which the Sun and planets rotated. The stars were fixed on a celestial sphere further out from the Sun and planets. What was on Earth was corrupt; what was in Heaven was perfect.

What passed for medicine also came from the Greeks, in particular, Hippocrates, in the 5th century BC. Human health was determined by the interplay of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile). Ill health meant an imbalance of the humors, which could require purging or bloodletting. These and other often fatal remedies continued to be used in the 18th and 19th centuries: George Washington himself died most likely as a result of bloodletting by his doctors when he fell ill in 1799.

In the 1500s, things started to crack for the feudal order and especially for the church. The Protestant Reformation is normally tagged to 1517, when Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the cathedral door in Wittenberg. This doctrinal split would lead to no small amount of bloodletting not intended for medical purposes—for example, the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). Rather more unnerving to the feudal structure was the Peasant War in Germany, beginning about 1525. The same Martin Luther wrote a pamphlet on this occasion titled “Against the Murderous and Thieving Hordes of Peasants.”

Galileo was born in 1564 to a noble—but not rich—family. Like many children before and after, he was taken to church by his parents, and evidently the sermons were as boring then as now. Unlike other kids, he made some good use of the time. He observed the great chandelier in the church, which would swing when disturbed by a breeze. He timed the swings using his pulse and found that the period was independent of the amplitude of the oscillation. That’s now Physics 101, and laid the basis for the first accurate clocks based on pendulums.

Galileo was above all a keen observer and experimentalist. When he heard that spectacle lenses were being used in Holland to view distant objects, he immediately constructed a crude telescope. Spurred by the results, he worked out his own procedures for grinding lenses to the exquisite tolerances needed for higher magnification, and produced a relatively small 20X to 30X telescope. He viewed the Moon, and saw not a perfect luminous disk but a place with geologic features just like the Earth—mountains, valleys, plains. When he looked at Jupiter, he saw little stars nearby seeming to move across the planetary disk. He immediately realized these were moons. Subsequently he observed Venus and saw it go through phases like the Earth’s moon.

These observations shattered the Ptolemaic model of an Earth-centered system and convinced Galileo that Copernicus’ idea that the Sun was the center of motion was in fact correct. For publishing this belief, Galileo was tried by the church in 1633 and, not surprisingly, convicted of heresy. Threatened with torture by the Inquisition, he recanted and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. From there he wrote his Mathematical Discourses Concerning Two New Sciences and had it smuggled out of reach of the Vatican to Holland, where it was published in 1638. His observations on the motions of falling bodies anticipated Isaac Newton’s synthesis 48 years later.

Why did Galileo recant? One answer is that he was scared by what happened to Giordano Bruno, the itinerant ex-priest who supported Copernicus’ idea about the Sun at the center, and much else. He was accused of heresy, imprisoned and tortured for seven years during his trial and finally burned at the stake in 1600. And the man who had ordered Galileo to abandon Copernican ideas in 1616 was the same Cardinal Bellarmine who sent Bruno to the stake. From what I have read, it is unfair to say that Galileo was a coward. First, Galileo’s book, giving very thinly veiled support to Copernicus’ theory, had been published in 1632 and already had circulated throughout Europe. Second, he had no substantial religious differences with the church on matters of theology, so a refusal to recant would mean torture and death for no real purpose.

Giordano Bruno was another matter, and it is very doubtful whether his recantation would have saved his life—he actually offered to partially recant in an appeal to the Pope. Just to give you an idea, here are a few of the things with which he was charged: 1) erroneous opinions on the Trinity and the divinity of Christ; 2) belief in the reincarnation of souls in new bodies, human or animal; and (the kicker) 3) denial of the virginity of Mary. There are not a few Christians who would roast poor Bruno today for that! You can imagine how well it went down with the Pope in 1600.

Science and the Industrial Revolution

Following Galileo, Newton produced his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Along with Gottfried Leibniz, he also invented differential calculus—the mathematics needed to solve the problems of moving bodies with forces such as gravity acting upon them. In biology, Carl Linnaeus introduced the systematic classification of animals and plants, based on form and structure. And in 1785, the Scot James Hutton laid the basis for modern geology and showed that the Earth had to be much, much older than the 6,000 years deduced by Bishop James Ussher (1581-1656) from a study of the biblical sources.

The middle to late 1700s was a period of tremendous advances in science and technology, driven by (and pushing forward) the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Science was held in high esteem by the rising entrepreneurs, and in the growing manufacturing city of Birmingham there arose an informal grouping called the Lunar Society, which coalesced around 1765 and lasted about 30 years.

The name came from their routine of evening dinner meetings on the Monday closest to the full moon, a practical idea since many had a trip of several miles on horseback to their homes, and there were no streetlights. That would change—one of the Lunatics (as the Society members jocularly called themselves) was William Murdoch, who was developing the production of gas from coal to use for illumination. Other notable members included James Watt, inventor of the condensing steam engine (which made steam power practical and efficient enough for its later use in locomotives); Joseph Priestley, the preacher and chemist credited with the discovery of oxygen; Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles and an evolutionist; and Josiah Wedgewood, chemist and mineralogist who made a fortune by making fine ceramics and pottery. Benjamin Franklin was a corresponding member—he was celebrated throughout Europe as an eminent scientist for his work on electricity.

Politically the Lunatics were pretty progressive for their day. Many had favored the colonists during the American War of Independence and also supported the revolutionaries in France. In fact, on 14 July 1791 they were having a dinner in Birmingham to celebrate the second anniversary of the fall of the Bastille when the inn was threatened by a mob howling “Church and King!” The mob’s main target was Joseph Priestley, whose support for the National Assembly won him an offer of French citizenship. Priestley’s house was set on fire by the mob, but fortunately he and his family escaped. They later emigrated to the U.S.

It is literally inconceivable to envisage something like the Lunar Society today. An approximation would be for the heads of U.S. Steel and General Motors to have joined with the leading professors of MIT and Harvard to sign a petition supporting Fidel Castro in his struggle against the U.S.-backed Batista dictatorship in Cuba in 1958!

The Lunatics mirrored capitalism in its youth, breaking down the barriers of feudalism as part of the practical struggle of the marketplace. Capitalism did bring a large increase in the productivity of labor and a corresponding vast increase in the amount of goods produced. Some of this trickled down even to the working class, whose labor created the surplus value pocketed by the capitalist as profit. However, exploitation of the most brutal fashion remained the lot of the masses, and the next economic dislocation causing a reduction or cessation of industrial production would (and did) throw the workers on to the street with no means of support. The scientific unraveling of the basis of capitalist production and profit was presented in detail by Karl Marx in his work Capital in 1867. But the core of Marxism—dialectical materialism—had been enunciated 20 years earlier in the Communist Manifesto.

The Science of Marxism

In his 1883 preface to the Communist Manifesto, Engels wrote:

“The basic thought running through the Manifesto—that economic production and the structure of society of every historical epoch necessarily arising therefrom constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently (ever since the dissolution of the primeval communal ownership of land) all history has been a history of class struggles, struggles between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and dominating classes at various stages of social development; that this struggle, however, has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed class (the proletariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the class which exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), without at the same time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation, oppression and class struggles—the basic thought belongs solely and exclusively to Marx.”

For the first time, the study of human society and its development had been given a firm scientific and materialist foundation. It is not surprising that Marx and Engels immediately appreciated the significance of Darwin’s Origin of Species, first published in 1859. The astounding variety of animals and plants in their myriad shapes and forms were not static sculptures made by a divine Creator, but had evolved from a common ancestor and differentiated over the expanse of geologic time. As Engels said in his 1883 speech at Marx’s grave:

“Just as Darwin discovered the law of development of organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means of subsistence, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case.”

The philosophical scaffold of Marxism is called dialectical materialism. Materialism, meaning that the world exists in reality; it was not created within the realm of the human mind. Dialectical in the fact that the essence of our world (indeed our universe) is matter in motion. All things exist not in stasis but in a process of development. An analogy is the difference between a still photograph and a motion picture. We know this almost by instinct when we look at plants and animals—consider the bud of a cherry tree, from emerging green speck in spring to flower to tasty fruit. But from birth in a class-divided society, we are made to accept the idea that the social structures and norms of human relations are essentially static—there are rulers and ruled, usually with God blessing the whole arrangement.

The genius of Marx was to apply the dialectical materialist method to the study of society and economy. In a 1914 piece titled “Karl Marx,” V.I. Lenin quotes Engels, adding his own interpolations:

“‘Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern natural science that it has furnished extremely rich [this was written before the discovery of radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements, etc.!] and daily increasing materials for this test, and has thus proved that in the last analysis Nature’s process is dialectical and not metaphysical.

“‘The great basic thought,’ Engels writes, ‘that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away…this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two different things…. For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendency from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain.’ Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is ‘the science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and of human thought’.”

The Dialectic of Science

Scientists seek to be as objective as possible, to eliminate systematic errors and to require that facts be established by experiments which can be repeated by others to confirm the results. Theories are built upon testable hypotheses, which lead to more experiments and further refinements of existing theory or creation of a new and better one. Science has its own dialectic—it is not static, but ever-changing. It is also materialist. Nature and her workings are to be explained using natural causes. Things happen for physical reasons, not the whim of a Zeus, Yahweh, tree spirit or water nymph. On one side science, on the other superstition, and ne’er the twain shall meet.

Any human activity such as science is subject to error, sometimes conscious, sometimes not. The human brain is very good at finding patterns. This was selected for by evolution. Our ancestors did not have the luxury of extended observation time to determine whether that shadowy figure in the grass was a grazing gazelle or a Smilodon with 7-inch fangs. But that pattern-seeking neural circuitry can also fool us. When I look at the sky I don’t immediately see bulls and crabs and hunters with studded belts. But given enough boredom, or perhaps eating the right mushrooms, one could certainly explain the constellations seen by Greek shepherds 2,500 years ago.

Another common fallacy is that correlation implies causality, which actually is an offshoot of seeking patterns where none really exist. An amusing example of correlation not being cause comes from an open letter to the Kansas School Board written by Bobby Henderson on behalf of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which was set up as a satirical protest against creationism:

“You may be interested to know that global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of Pirates since the 1800s. For your interest, I have included a graph of the approximate number of pirates versus the average global temperature over the last 200 years. As you can see, there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between pirates and global temperature.”

Above all, one must remember that scientists are human and work in the midst of a class-divided society. Even a religious physicist can be objective when measuring the distance between the Earth and Moon, but as one approaches social questions and research, ingrained bias emanating from the dominant social mores can sometimes overwhelm the best of objective intentions.

Marx's analysis of the laws of capital and the share market crisis - By Nick Beams (Boston Indie) 17 February 2018,Liberal,1,7yv0gs,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/7yv0gs/marxs_analysis_of_the_laws_of_capital_and_the/,0,"Marx's analysis of the laws of capital and the share market crisis By Nick Beams 17 February 2018

Down through the years one of the most persistent attacks on Karl Marx by the high priests of bourgeois economics--the ideological guardians of the profit system--has been his contention that, in the final analysis, capitalism depends on the impoverishment of the working class.

History, they maintain, has proven otherwise and refuted Marx. While there have been periods of crisis, and rapid and even prolonged falls in the living standards of the masses, in the long run the profit system has served to uplift them and will continue to do so into the indefinite future, whatever fluctuations it may undergo.

Moreover, there is no possible alternative because the market system is not a historically developed mode of production, which came into being at one point and is therefore destined to pass away like earlier modes of production before it, slavery and feudalism. Rather, it is rooted in the laws of nature itself and is necessary and therefore eternal. In other words, despite some imperfections, which may give rise to problems at certain points, all is really for the best in the best of all possible worlds.

In feudal times, the high priests of the Church, who played the key role in sustaining and sanctifying the ruling classes of their day, maintained that when crises arose this was not a product of the social system but an ""act of God,"" a punishment for the sins of man deriving from his fall.

While there have been enormous advances in social and political thought since then--a product of the Enlightenment and the vast advances in the scientific understanding--the modus operandi of the present day ""high priests"" of capitalist economy, the bourgeois economists and pundits, is not altogether different from their predecessors.

When confronted with economic crises and their persistence, they maintain that these are not a product of the inexorable workings of the capitalist system itself, but arise from ""market imperfections"" or some external, unforeseen or accidental event. That is, they proceed, as Marx put it, on the basis that so long as capitalism acts according to the textbooks--the modern day scriptures used to justify the present socio-economic order--crises are not endemic to the system.

The events of the past two weeks, with the largest fall in markets since the crisis of 2008, raising the spectre of an even bigger disaster than that of a decade ago, have provided a damning exposure of this entire ideological framework.

Before going into a deeper analysis of the underlying driving forces and the inherent and irresolvable contradictions of which these events are an expression, let us begin with one undeniable economic fact.

In the decade since the eruption of the global financial crisis of 2008, none of the underlying contradictions that exploded to the surface has been resolved. At the same time, the immediate and ongoing consequences of the breakdown have been the reduction of the living standards of billions of people, while creating unprecedented wealth for a capitalist oligarchy occupying the heights of society. Or as Marx put it, the accumulation of wealth at one pole, amid poverty, misery and degradation at the other.

Whatever the immediate outcome, the financial turmoil of the past days has established, as an undeniable reality, the continuing threat of a meltdown of the capitalist economy. It hangs like a sword of Damocles over the working masses of the world, destined to fall, if not in this crisis, then in others to come.

Moreover, one of the most striking features of the latest crisis, is that it was not sparked by the immediate threat of recession but by news that economic growth was enjoying an uptick--the best period of synchronised global growth since 2009, according to the International Monetary Fund. Most significantly, it was triggered by data showing that wages in the US experienced their largest annual rise since 2009.

Most of what passed for analysis in the bourgeois media did little better than the tweet forthcoming from the very limited intelligence of US President Donald Trump. He noted: ""In the 'old days,' when good news was reported the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!""

Trump's ""analysis"" omitted a central feature of the market rise over the past nine years. It has not taken place on the basis of ""good news"" but in a period of the lowest growth in any ""recovery"" in the post-World War II period. It has been sustained only by the continued inflow of ultra-cheap money from the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks.

Lawrence Summers, former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and now Harvard professor of economics, was slightly more insightful. ""This is not yet a major earthquake,"" he wrote. ""Whether it's an early tremor or a random fluctuation remains to be seen. I'm nervous and will stay nervous. [It is] far from clear that good growth and stable finance are compatible.""

Summers is at least vaguely aware that in the present situation there is something deeply troubling for the capitalist class for which he speaks. The very measures undertaken in response to the last crisis, supposedly aimed at restoring economic health and growth, may in fact have created the conditions for another financial disaster as growth begins to rise.

The tendency of the rate of profit to fall

To analyse the present situation, it is necessary to leave the sphere of bourgeois economics--based on the premise that there are no inherent and objective contradictions in the profit system--and probe its historical development on the basis of the laws of motion of the capitalist economy uncovered by Marx.

The ongoing turmoil in financial markets, beginning with the Wall Street crash of October 1987, must be analysed on the basis of one of the most important contradictions of the capitalist economy explained by Marx. That is the long-term tendency of the rate of profit to fall.

This tendency was noted by the foremost representatives of English classical political economy--Adam Smith and David Ricardo--who preceded Marx in the period when the bourgeoisie was a rising and progressive class.

While Smith and Ricardo found the tendency of the rate of profit to fall deeply disturbing, especially the latter because of its implications for the long-term future of the capitalist economy, they were unable to give any scientific explanation for it. That was provided by Marx, beginning with his uncovering of the secret of surplus value.

While Smith and Ricardo had the notion that the origin of surplus value was the labour of the developing working class, its actual source always remained a mystery to Marx's predecessors. How was it possible, they cudgelled their brains, on the basis of the laws of commodity exchange in the market, where equivalents exchange for equivalents, for a surplus to arise and for this surplus to be appropriated by capital?

Marx's solution consisted in his probing of the most important commodity exchange in capitalist economy, that between capital and labour. He showed that the commodity which the worker sold to the capitalist was not, as had been previously maintained, his or her labour, but labour power, the capacity to work.

Like every other commodity in the market, labour power's value was determined by the value of the commodities needed to reproduce it--in this case, the value of the commodities needed to sustain the individual worker and his or her family to ensure the continued supply of wage workers.

Surplus value arose from the difference between the value created by the worker in the course of the working day through the production process, and the value of the commodity, labour power, that the worker sold to capital through the wage contract.

The raw materials and machinery used up in the production process did not add new value, but passed on to the final product the value they already embodied.

Yet the analysis was not yet complete. The rate of profit had to be explained. This rate was not determined at the level of the individual capitalist firm, but at the level of the capitalist economy as a whole. It was given by the ratio of the total surplus value extracted from the working class to the total capital outlaid--the expenditure on labour power plus the expenditure on the means of production, raw materials and machinery.

The tendency of the rate of profit to fall arose not from some external factor, Marx showed, but from a contradiction at the very heart of this process.

The development of capitalist production led to the expansion of the productive forces and the use of ever-larger amounts of raw materials and machinery in the production process. As a result, expenditure on materials and machinery tended to comprise an increasing proportion of the total capital laid out. But this increased expenditure on what Marx called constant capital, as opposed to the expenditure on labour power, or variable capital, did not give rise to additional or surplus value.

Because the rate of profit was determined by the ratio of total surplus value to the total mass of capital--constant and variable--employed, there was an inherent tendency for it to decline.

Now, as Marx clearly identified, there were countervailing factors. These included: the increased exploitation of the working class in order to widen the difference between the value of labour power and the value created by the worker in the course of the working day; the lowering of wages to below the value of labour power, enforced through the creation of unemployment and a surplus working population; the cheapening of the costs of raw materials and machinery, so reducing the total value of capital on which the rate of profit was calculated; and the expansion of foreign trade.

But while these countervailing factors lessened the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, and at times could operate very powerfully--even lifting the profit rate--the basic tendency continually reasserted itself.

Marx characterised the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the most important law of political economy, above all from an historical point of view. This was because, on the one hand, it drove capital to develop the productive forces in an attempt to overcome its effects, while, on the other, it was the source of the continually recurring crises that beset the capitalist mode of production.

Marx's critics and the end of the post-war boom

With the development of the post-war capitalist boom, extending from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, Marx's law, it was claimed, had been refuted by historical events. As had been seen in the case of the German revisionist Eduard Bernstein at the end of the 19th century, the attack on Marx's analysis came from those who claimed to be his followers, but insisted it needed to be revised and updated.

The assault on Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall was at the centre of one of the most influential books of the late 1960s, Monopoly Capital, written by the ""independent"" Marxist economist Paul Sweezy in co-authorship with Paul Baran in the midst of the post-war boom.

Sweezy, the founder of the journal Monthly Review, had already cast considerable doubt on the validity of Marx's law in his first book, The Theory of Capitalist Development, published in 1941. He now maintained that Marx had developed the law under conditions of competition in the 19th century and that in 20th century monopoly capitalism it no longer applied, if it ever had.

Sweezy maintained that the key question confronting capital was not the insufficient extraction of surplus value relative to the ever-growing mass of capital--the issue to which Marx's law had pointed--but the reverse. Monopoly capital created an increased mass of surplus value that had to be continually ""absorbed.""

A key aspect of Sweezy's theory, flowing directly from his economic analysis, was that in the advanced capitalist countries, dominated by monopolies, the working class was no longer a revolutionary force. The vehicle for socialist revolution, he claimed, was now the masses in the so-called Third World countries, striving for national liberation.

Monopoly Capital is no longer widely read but it continues to exert an influence. David Harvey, for example, adheres to much of Sweezy's economic analysis, as well as his insistence on the non-revolutionary role of the working class.

However, as so often happens, Sweezy's ""refutation"" of Marx came right at the point when developments in the capitalist economy were confirming Marx's scientific insights. Earlier, Bernstein had maintained that the Marxist analysis of the inevitable breakdown of capitalism was rendered a fiction by the boom beginning in the late 1890s. The collapse of Bernstein's prognosis came just 14 years after its elaboration, with the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

In Sweezy's case, his refutation was almost instantaneous. The publication of Monopoly Capital in 1966 came at a point when profit rates in the advanced capitalist economies were starting to turn down. This led to mounting economic problems and the rise of class tensions that were soon to produce potentially revolutionary struggles by the working class from 1968 to 1975.

Starting with the May-June 1968 general strike in France, the largest and most extended in history, and including the 1969 hot autumn in Italy, the 1974 miners' strike that brought down the Tory government in Britain, the revolutionary situation in Chile (1970-73) and the upheavals in the US, to name just some of the events, world capitalism was shaken to its foundations.

With the direct collaboration of the Stalinist, social democratic and trade union apparatuses, which betrayed these struggles, the capitalist classes were able to bring the situation under control and maintain their rule.

However, the underlying economic problems of the US and other major capitalist economies, rooted in declining profit rates, remained. Having kept themselves in the saddle, the ruling classes undertook a massive offensive against the working class, coupled with restructuring the world economy.

The global counter-offensive was initiated in the US under Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who put in place a high-interest rate regime. Its purpose was two-fold: to wipe out unprofitable sections of industry and force a major industrial restructure, and eliminate the large industrial complexes that were the centres of militant working class struggles in an earlier period. The Volcker purge had vast global ramifications, leading in 1982-83 to the most serious global recession since the Great Depression.

The decade of the 1980s was characterised by major class battles, of which the mass sacking of US air traffic controllers in 1981 by Reagan and the state violence unleashed by the Thatcher Tory government against the British miners' strike in 1984-85 were two of the most prominent. The decade also saw a fundamental transformation in the role of the trade unions. From organisations that had fought for limited gains by the working class, they betrayed all of its struggles as they became the chief enforcers of the program of pro-market, capitalist restructuring.

The attack on the social position of the working class--aimed at increasing the extraction of surplus value to counter the fall in the rate of profit--was accompanied by a reorganisation of production, through downsizing and globalisation to take advantage of cheaper sources of labour.

The growth of financial speculation

Crucial to this restructuring was the freeing of financial capital from the restrictions and regulations that were set in place following the disastrous experiences of the 1930s. The growing operations of finance, through the issuing of so-called junk bonds and other measures, were central to hostile takeovers, downsizing and mergers and acquisitions that transformed the organisation of capitalist production.

At the same time, the pressure on profit rates, as Marx predicted, resulted in a turn by capital to operations in the financial markets and speculative ventures as a means of profit accumulation.

This process led to financial storms by the end of the 1980s, with the eruption of the savings and loans debacle and the October 1987 share market crash, in which the Dow plunged by more than 22 percent in a single day.

The response of the incoming Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, represented a major turning point. He committed the central bank to the provision of liquidity to the financial markets in what became known as the ""Greenspan put."" In effect, the Fed became the guarantor to the financial markets, reversing previous policy.

While the October 1987 crash was the most severe one-day fall in history--a position it retains to this day--it did not lead to a broader crisis in the economy as a whole.

This was because the onslaught against the working class in the US and the first wave of globalisation, marked by the transfer of large areas of industrial production to the cheaper-labour countries of East Asia, the ""Asian Tigers,"" was beginning to lift the rate of profit.

This was reinforced after 1991 with the liquidation of the Soviet Union and the consequent abandonment by countries such as India of their nationally-regulated development programs and the increasing turn to the free market.

China, which became a source of cheap labour production in the 1980s through the establishment of special economic zones, opened up still further. The Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 was the signal by the Chinese Communist Party regime that it stood ready, by whatever means necessary, to ensure the exploitation of the Chinese working class by global capital.

In the first period of the Clinton presidency, beginning in 1993, the US economy enjoyed rising profit rates as a result of the boost provided by the exploitation of cheaper labour, paid as little as one thirtieth of US wages.

However, the basic tendency identified by Marx began to reassert itself from around 1997, when the average US profit rate began to turn down. As a result, the accumulation of profits by financial means, which had grown by leaps and bounds in the 1990s, became increasingly vulnerable.

By 1996, Greenspan pointed to what he called ""irrational exuberance,"" expressed in the tendency of stock prices to become ever-more divorced from the real economy. This warning, however, came to nothing. Greenspan, responding to the dictates and demands of finance capital, turned more openly to the provision of cheap money for speculation.

The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 was a significant turning point. It produced a depression in South-East Asia equivalent in scope to that of the 1930s in the advanced capitalist countries, but Clinton dismissed it as a mere ""glitch"" on the road to globalisation.

That was followed by the 1998 collapse of the US investment fund Long Term Capital Management, which had to be wound up in an operation conducted by the New York Federal Reserve, lest its demise brought down the whole financial system.

The dot.com bubble was then getting under way as the Fed provided ever-cheaper money. And at the behest of the financial markets, the last remnants of the regulatory mechanisms controlling their predatory operations, put in place as a result of the 1930s depression, were scrapped with the Clinton administration's 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.

The 2001 collapse of Enron revealed the dubious practices and outright criminality that increasingly marked the speculative financial bubble. Enron had pioneered new accounting practices in which profit was decided in advance to meet market expectations and then the accounts were manipulated to show the desired result.

Following the collapse of the tech and dot.com bubble, finance capital turned to the development of new methods for speculative profit accumulation, again facilitated with cheap money from the Fed. It developed highly complex and arcane financial derivatives, centred on the sub-prime mortgage market, but extending well beyond it. Goldman Sachs, among others, was a key player. It issued new products that it knew would eventually fail, but made money in the meantime by financing both sides of the deals.

The 2008 global financial crisis

In April 2007, the then chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, dismissed the possibility that the growing signs of problems with sub-prime mortgages could impact the broader market because these products only amounted to a $50 billion operation.

However, when the crisis erupted, it engulfed the entire financial system, threatening to bring down the insurance giant AIG following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This was because the methods employed in the sub-prime market were not ""rogue"" activities but typical of the financial markets as a whole.

The response of the Fed and other central banks to the 2008 crisis marked another decisive turning point. No longer was it a question of stepping in to rescue a failed individual firm. Massive intervention was required to prop up the US and global financial system as a whole.

The lowering of interest rates to historic lows--in some cases to negative levels--and the injection of trillions of dollars into the financial system did not overcome the contradictions manifested in speculation--the expression of the laws of the capitalist mode of production laid bare by Marx--but exacerbated them.

The rise and rise of financial wealth accumulation in the decade following the 2008 crisis is not the outcome of growth in the real economy. In fact, the ""recovery"" since 2009 has been the weakest in the post-war period, and marked by the fall of investment in the real economy to historic lows and a decline in productivity.

After the Lehman crisis, finance capital responded to the blowing up of its previous mechanisms for profit accumulation via speculation by creating new ones. One of these, exchange traded notes based on ""shorting"" the volatility index, or Vix--that is, betting on continued market calm, has now resulted in the most significant turbulence since the 2008 crash.

However, these new forms of speculation are only a trigger. The broader significance of the recent volatility and whatever else eventuates--no one is sure that the storm has passed--is that it was provoked by the prospect of faster growth and a push by the working class for higher wages following decades of the suppression of the class struggle.

Economic events have once again confirmed the essential conclusion of Marx's analysis of the laws of motion of the capitalist economy. Whatever its ups and downs and even periods of long upturn, the accumulation of profit--the essential driving force of capitalism--is, in the final analysis, based on the ongoing suppression of the working class and its impoverishment.

The lie, which forms the basis of all bourgeois economics, that somehow the growth of capitalist economy can, at least in the long run, provide the road to advancement for the mass of humanity, the working class, the producers of all wealth, has been exposed. It has been laid bare by the fact that signs of economic growth and a growing movement of workers against the decline in living standards have raised the prospect of a new financial disaster, even more serious than that of a decade ago.

Marx's analysis of the laws of motion of capital--laws which express themselves, as he put it, in the same way that the law of gravity asserts itself when a house collapses around our ears--far from being refuted or rendered outdated, have been confirmed by living events.

This analysis, and Marx's central conclusion that the working class has to take conscious control of the very wealth it has produced, must become its guiding perspective in the struggles now unfolding.

This historic task does not arise out of an abstract theoretical construct. In opposition to all the nostrums of bourgeois economy, which are self-serving justifications of the capitalist system, Marx's analysis is a scientific elaboration of the objective tendencies and inherent logic of capitalist development.

This logic, which assumes ever-more explosive forms, now poses directly before the international working class the necessity, if humanity is to avert a catastrophe and advance, to fight in every struggle for a perspective based on the overthrow of the reactionary and historically-outmoded profit system. That is the essential meaning of the latest round of turmoil on the financial markets.

Independence for Catalonia! Down With the EU!

Spain Strangles Catalonia

For Workers Republics!

OCTOBER 30—Three days ago, the parliament of Catalonia voted to secede from Spain and establish an independent Catalan republic. Minutes later, the Spanish senate, dominated by the Castilian chauvinists of the right-wing Popular Party (PP) and of the social-democratic Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), voted to dissolve the Catalan parliament and depose the regional government.

Madrid is officially seizing control of Catalonia, including its finances, police force and major TV and radio stations under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which enables the rulers of the Spanish prison house of oppressed peoples to strip autonomous communities of their powers. It has also ordered new regional elections on December 21. Catalan pro-independence deputies, including President Carles Puigdemont (of the Partit Demòcrata Europeu Català, PDeCAT) and his vice president Oriol Junqueras (of the Esquerra Republicana, ERC) have been threatened with arrest for “rebellion,” for which they could spend as long as 30 years in prison. Two prominent leaders of independentiste groups, Jordi Sànchez of the Catalan National Assembly and Jordi Cuixart of Òmnium Cultural, were imprisoned on October 16 and face trial for sedition.

The Spanish state unleashed a wave of repression in late September in an attempt to suppress the October 1 Catalan independence referendum. Over two million people cast ballots, courageously defying the thousands of vicious Guardia Civil and Policía Nacional sent by Madrid. Ninety percent voted in favor of independence. Since then, Catalonia and its largest city, Barcelona, have been rocked by huge protests demanding an end to the repression and freedom for the imprisoned independence leaders. Several chauvinist protests have also taken place, led by the neo-Francoist PP, the right-wing Ciutadans and the social-democratic Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya (PSC), in defense of the unity of monarchical, Castile-ruled capitalist Spain. It is in the interests of the working class throughout Spain and France to defend the oppressed Catalan people, whose nation straddles the Franco-Spanish border. Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil out of Catalonia! Free Cuixart, Sànchez and all pro-independence activists! Down with the monarchy! Defend Catalan independence!

Like Catalonia, the oppressed Basque nation in Euskal Herria (the Basque Country) stretches from Spain into France. For decades, the Basques have suffered deadly repression at the hands of both the Spanish and French governments. As proletarian revolutionary internationalists, we fight for the independence of the Basque Country and Catalonia, North and South—that is, against the capitalist rulers of both France and Spain. We seek to build Leninist-Trotskyist parties that support the just struggles of oppressed nations, which can be a lever to advance the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat against the capitalist rulers. Our program is for proletarian revolution, the seizure of power by the working class. For workers republics in Catalonia and the Basque Country as parts of a voluntary Socialist United States of Europe!

For the Catalan workers and poor, the struggle for national liberation is a component part of their struggle against exploitation. The potential power of the working class was demonstrated in a small but important way by the port workers in Barcelona and Tarragona, who refused to service the ships being used to house the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil at the time of the referendum. But Catalan workers have not been mobilized as an independent force due to their wretched reformist misleaders, who, on the whole, refuse to fight for Catalan independence. For this reason, Catalan workers are dissolved into the mass movement, and pro-independence working-class militants have nowhere to look for their liberation except to the bourgeois nationalists. It is necessary to forge a revolutionary proletarian leadership that champions the struggle for national liberation.

No Illusions in the Catalan Bourgeoisie!

Amid fears that an independent Catalonia would be kicked out of the European Union (EU), a host of Catalan companies, including two large banks, CaixaBank and Banco Sabadell, promptly seized on Madrid’s offerings and opted to register their headquarters outside Catalonia. The Catalan bourgeoisie (represented prominently by the PDeCAT and its predecessors, as well as by the ERC) has sometimes used separatism as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Madrid. But the chauvinist, vindictive humiliations inflicted by the central government, as well as pressure from the Catalan masses, have pushed the political representatives of a section of the Catalan bourgeoisie into open defiance. Puigdemont postponed declaring independence after the October 1 referendum, and even offered to hold early regional elections if PP prime minister Mariano Rajoy would guarantee that Catalonia would retain its autonomous status. But the Castilian-chauvinist Rajoy and his cohorts would have nothing less than total capitulation. Thus, the Catalan government declared independence.

Madrid has made clear that it will go to any lengths to maintain the territorial integrity of Spain, while Catalonia lacks anything resembling a state of its own—centrally, armed forces—that could resist the Spanish state. The Catalan working class, meanwhile, has given no sign of significant independent motion. Under these circumstances, there is no hope of realizing Catalan independence now. Yet Catalonia remains in turmoil. With the immediate prospect of further repression and humiliation at the hands of the Castilian overlords, combined with the impotence of the Catalan bourgeoisie, further struggles are likely to erupt—the Catalan masses are in dire need of allies.

Such allies are to be found primarily in the proletariat of Spain and France. The Spanish and French bourgeoisies are both oppressing the Catalans and Basques and exploiting the working class as a whole. The breakup of the reactionary Spanish state would open the road for workers struggle against the capitalist rulers in Madrid. A relentless struggle must be waged against the chauvinism promoted by social democrats and the labor lieutenants of capital in the trade-union bureaucracies in order to win workers in the region to the fight for self-determination of the oppressed nations.

The struggle of the Catalan people has resonated across the border with Basques and Catalans living in France. Protests in support of Catalan independence have taken place in both the north and south of Euskal Herria. In an act of solidarity by Catalans in France, the ballots for the October 1 referendum were printed in Catalunya Nord and transported across the border.

Despite the Catalan government’s constant appeals, the rulers of the reactionary, imperialist EU have backed Madrid’s repression to the hilt, precisely because they know that a breakup of Spain portends a breakup of the EU. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned that “we need to avoid splits, because we already have enough splits and fractures,” and that the EU could not be made up of “95 different states.” The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, made it clear on October 22 that “no one is going to recognise Catalonia in Europe as an independent country.” The EU is an instrument for the imperialist powers of Europe, centrally Germany, to ratchet up the exploitation of the working people throughout Europe and to further impoverish weaker countries such as Greece and Portugal.

For Proletarian Political Independence!

The Rajoy government’s repression, supported by its lapdogs in the PSOE, has evoked memories of the dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco and its savage suppression of Basque, Catalan and Galician national rights. PP spokesman Pablo Casado didn’t hesitate to invoke this bloody history when he warned Puigdemont not to declare independence “because perhaps the person who makes the declaration will end up like the person who made the declaration 83 years ago.” This is a reference to Lluís Companys, the bourgeois-nationalist president of the Catalan Generalitat who was executed by a Francoist firing squad after the defeat of the Spanish Revolution. (See “Trotskyism vs. Popular Frontism in the Spanish Civil War,” Spartacist [English-language edition] No. 61, Spring 2009.)

The reality is that the repression being meted out today is fully in keeping with the legal framework of Spanish bourgeois democracy. The oppression of the Basque, Catalan and Galician nations was enshrined in the 1978 post-Franco constitution, which maintains that Spain cannot be divided. The two historic parties of the Spanish working class, the PSOE and the Communist Party (PCE), supported the formation of a monarchical state based on the denial of the right to self-determination of the oppressed nations of Spain and voted for the 1978 constitution.

The PSOE in government loyally served the king and fomented Castilian chauvinism for decades, notoriously setting up death squads to murder Basque independence fighters in the 1980s. For its own part, the PCE has also maintained its disgusting opposition to independence for the oppressed. The chauvinist misleaders of the CCOO and UGT union federations bear responsibility for the fact that workers in Catalonia and Spain have not come out as an organized force in defense of independence for Catalonia and the Basque Country.

The PSOE’s Catalan counterpart, the PSC, joined with Francoists and fascists in a reactionary demonstration in Barcelona on October 8 and October 29, under slogans such as “Catalonia is Spain.” Emboldened by Rajoy’s offensive, on October 27 fascists attacked the headquarters of Catalunya Ràdio as well as a Catalan cultural center and school in Barcelona. The fascists are a deadly danger to all workers, immigrants and oppressed minorities, and the working class must be mobilized to stop them.

With the PSOE heavily discredited among working people for having mercilessly administered EU-dictated austerity, the bourgeois Podemos party—which issued out of the 2011 petty-bourgeois Indignados movement—has taken up the task of refurbishing Spanish bourgeois democracy. Podemos has mobilized protests in opposition to Rajoy’s repression against Catalonia. But Podemos is firmly opposed to Catalan independence and merely provides brutal Castilian chauvinism with a “human face”: an October 23 letter to its membership decried any declaration of Catalan independence as “illegitimate.” Podemos advises the Spanish bourgeoisie to “ensure that Catalonia remains a part of Spain” with the carrot of greater democracy, rather than the stick of repression. Podemos has moved to strip the leadership of its Catalan organization (Podem) of its authority for not being hard enough against independence.

A more left-appearing Catalan bourgeois-nationalist party is the Candidatura d’Unitat Popular (CUP). Although the CUP claims to be socialist, in fact it is a party based on the petty bourgeoisie. It propped up the regional capitalist government for more than a year. The affiliate of the British Socialist Workers Party in Catalonia, En Lluita, liquidated completely into the CUP last year. These opportunists had no trouble simultaneously building the pro-independence CUP in Catalonia, while building the anti-independence Podemos in other parts of Spain, i.e., capitulating to one bourgeois nationalism or another.

No such confusion afflicts the fake-Trotskyist Internationalist Group (IG), which capitulates entirely to Castilian chauvinism. In their article “Defend the Right to Self-Determination and Independence for Catalonia” (September 2017) they do anything but defend Catalan independence. The IG denigrates the Catalan people’s just struggle for national liberation, sneering: “This is a nationalist movement led by the richest bourgeoisie in Spain” and “The impulse for independence comes above all from powerful sectors of the well-to-do Catalan bourgeoisie.” You’d think the IG had taken a page from the Francoist newspaper ABC, which wrote that the “Catalanist revolt against the state is a performance of the rich, by the rich and for the rich” (4 June).

These petty-bourgeois professors in the U.S. urged Catalans to battle their way to the polling stations on October 1—defying police truncheons, rubber bullets and tear gas—to “cast a blank ballot”! Dripping with contempt for the oppressed Catalans, the IG rants: “It’s not like some national liberation movement in a semi-colonial country.” The IG’s counterposition between national liberation struggles in the backward and advanced countries reveals their fundamentally Third World nationalist perspective. Further, the IG argues that Catalonia’s separation from Spain “could seriously undercut the potential for united struggle of the working class throughout the peninsula” (“Mass Resistance to Police Repression in Catalonia,” 4 October).

It is Madrid’s national oppression of Catalans, Basques and Galicians that has undercut the unity of the working classes in the artificial Spanish state. This unity can only be achieved by boldly championing the liberation of the oppressed nations—the opposite of the IG’s left-talking chauvinism, which blames the oppressed Catalans for dividing the working class, rather than the Castilian bourgeoisie and its reformist lackeys.

Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin emphasized that achieving proletarian unity requires breaking the chains binding an oppressed nation to its oppressor. He used as an example Norway, which gained independence from Sweden following a 1905 referendum:

“The close alliance between the Norwegian and Swedish workers, their complete fraternal class solidarity, gained from the Swedish workers’ recognition of the right of the Norwegians to secede. This convinced the Norwegian workers that the Swedish workers were not infected with Swedish nationalism, and that they placed fraternity with the Norwegian proletarians above the privileges of the Swedish bourgeoisie and aristocracy. The dissolution of the ties imposed upon Norway by the monarchs of Europe and the Swedish aristocracy strengthened the ties between the Norwegian and Swedish workers.”

—“The Right of Nations to Self-Determination” (1914)

As explained in the current issue of our international theoretical journal, Spartacist (No. 65, Summer 2017), Lenin’s steadfast defense of the right of self-determination and implacable opposition to Great Russian chauvinism were crucial in forging the Bolshevik Party. It was Lenin’s revolutionary internationalist program that allowed the Bolsheviks to lead the working class to power 100 years ago. Today, the ICL upholds Leninism on the national question as part of our struggle for new October Revolutions.

Ideologues of Decaying Capitalism

The Bankruptcy of Liberal Economists

By Joseph Seymour and Bruce André

(Part Two)

This part concludes the article, Part One of which appeared in WV No. 1125 (12 January). (Part One - https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersVanguard2/comments/7qtzfg/ideologues_of_decaying_capitalism_the_bankruptcy/?st=jd5d5vnr&sh=1e01032c)

Economist Marc Levinson in An Extraordinary Time and his more liberal counterpart Robert J. Gordon in The Rise and Fall of American Growth both address the slowdown in the U.S. growth rate since the 1970s. Levinson at least recognizes that the slowdown was rooted in a decline in investment, although he provides no explanation for that decline. Gordon provides an explanation that is more apologetic for the capitalist system and even more pessimistic regarding future prospects.

Gordon’s implicit premise is that all progressive technological innovations—in the spheres of both production and consumer goods—have been and will be transformed into new, widely marketed (that is, generally affordable) commodities, although in some cases with a lengthy time lag. To paraphrase Voltaire’s parody of the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, with regard to technological innovation Gordon views American capitalism as the best of all possible worlds. If the possibilities for growth have diminished in recent decades, it is because the intrinsic character of technological innovations has changed in a way that diminishes their effect on productivity.

The structure of Gordon’s historical study of U.S. economic growth is based on the concept of three successive industrial revolutions. The first industrial revolution (IR #1) derived from inventions developed between 1770 and 1820, primarily the steam engine and its offshoots—railroads, steamships and the shift from wood to iron and steel. The second industrial revolution (IR #2) derived from technology developed in the late 19th century, particularly electricity and the internal combustion engine. The third industrial revolution (IR #3), beginning in the 1960s, was centered on new information and communication technology (ICT), such as computers and smartphones.

According to Gordon, the root cause of the slowdown in U.S. economic growth in recent decades was the diminishing effects of the second industrial revolution and the insufficient potency of the third:

“This decline in productivity growth by almost half reflects the ebbing tide of the productivity stimulus provided by the great inventions of IR #2. Its successor, the ICT-oriented IR #3, was sufficiently potent to cause a revival in the productivity growth trend to an average of 2.05 percent during the decade 1995-2004. But the power of ICT-related innovations to boost productivity growth petered out after 2004.”

Gordon never considers the possibility that some progressive technological innovations might not be transformed into widely marketed commodities because it is not profitable to do so. Later we will address his insistence that computerization and new digital technologies in general cannot significantly increase labor productivity in the future. In fact, he maintains that these technologies have pretty much exhausted their potential.

Here we will consider Gordon’s implicit assumption that all new, widely marketed commodities were more efficient than those they replaced and improved the living standards of the populace. In particular, let’s consider the partial replacement of electrified streetcars and subway and elevated trains by the automobile, which began between 1910 and 1930. Gordon analyzes the transition from one means of personal transportation to another in some detail. However, he does not attempt to measure their comparative techno-economic efficiency. Did electrified subways and elevated trains expend greater or lesser economic resources per passenger mile than Model T Fords? And if lesser, wherein lay the advantages of the automobile?

Gordon does acknowledge that the ascendancy of the automobile was not just the result of the workings of “free market” capitalism. Government policy was a very important causal factor:

“Government policies encouraged urban sprawl and undermined the financial viability of urban transit and passenger railways. Even before World War II, public policy was skewed in favor of the automobile by building streets and highways with public funds while leaving urban transit and interurban electric railways to operate as self-sufficient private companies. Many of the early roads were built by issuing bonds on which the interest was paid by local property taxes, so the automobile owner and transit rider paid equally to build a road system that made the automobile ever more attractive than transit.”

However, Gordon offers no judgment on whether government policies that favored automobile travel at the expense of public mass transit were economically rational and socially beneficial. Nor does he address why state and local governments pursued auto-friendly policies. The answer, of course, is primarily rooted in the capitalist drive for profits: The bourgeois politicians involved were beholden to the owners of the big car companies, like Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors, and also the rubber and oil companies that provided tires and gasoline.

Class Struggle and a Shorter Workweek

Gordon states: “This book is about not just the standard of living from the viewpoint of the consumer, but also the quality of working conditions both outside and inside the home.” In keeping with his main theme, that the American people experienced a qualitative improvement in everyday conditions of life during the first half of the 20th century, Gordon cites the reduction in the average workweek from 60 hours at the turn of the century to 41 hours by 1950. But his liberal worldview blinds him to both the fundamental cause of that important change in the lives of working people and the inherent limitation of its impact on their quality of life.

According to Gordon, the decrease in the average workweek resulted from an interest shared by business owners and their workers in having a rested and healthy workforce:

“Interpretations of the movement for shorter hours center on the widespread belief on the part of both firms and labor leaders that a reduction in hours would improve work performance and increase production. Higher productivity and higher real wages made possible a gradual reduction of hours of work, for the onerous demands of sixty- and seventy-two-hour work weeks had created an exhausted male working class.”

To back up his view, Gordon cites legislation passed during the Progressive Era in the early 20th century and the New Deal in the 1930s.

In fact, the 40-hour workweek was won through decades of hard-fought and often bloody class battles by the workers movement. Agitation by the nascent industrial working class for the eight-hour day and for unions led to the Great Rail Strike of 1877, which was brutally suppressed by the Army. In the 1886 Haymarket massacre, Chicago police attacked workers rallying for the eight-hour day and arrested eight anarchist labor organizers who were subsequently framed up and imprisoned or executed. In the 1937 “Little Steel” strike, whose demands included a 40-hour week, police killed ten workers near the gates of Republic Steel in South Chicago in what became known as the “Memorial Day Massacre.”

Today, after decades of one-sided class warfare by the bourgeoisie and givebacks by the hidebound trade-union bureaucracy, the 40-hour workweek has been substantially eroded. The average workweek for full-time U.S. workers has risen to about 47 hours, nearly a full extra eight-hour day per week. About one in five full-time workers toil 60 or more hours a week, while millions are unemployed or forced to work part-time.

Workers need to fight for a shorter workweek with no loss in pay, linking the fight for decent working conditions to the struggle for jobs for all. A 30-hour workweek at 40 hours’ pay, with the available work divided among everyone, would go a long way toward addressing both unemployment and the serious safety problems resulting from fatigue and understaffing.

The capitalists would, of course, reply that such demands are not practical—at least, not if they are to maintain their obscene wealth. Indeed, the felt needs of the working class run right up against the inability of the capitalist system to satisfy them. The solution will not be found in the struggle, however necessary, by workers for a slightly bigger share of society’s wealth against a capitalist ruling class determined to maximize its profits. The goal must be a wholly different type of society, a workers America where the productive wealth has been ripped out of the hands of the tiny capitalist elite and put at the disposal of the vast majority. Such a society can be achieved only when the working class, led by a revolutionary party, overthrows capitalist class rule through a socialist revolution and establishes a workers government.

On Labor and the Quality of Life

Like the class battles that won the 40-hour week, the steady erosion of this historic gain for labor since the late 1970s is for Gordon a closed book. Yet even if we accept his focus on the first half of the 20th century, when the workweek was reduced from 60 to 40 hours, this gain actually constituted something less than a qualitative change in the lives of American working people. While deploring growing income inequality in the U.S. in recent decades, Gordon does not address or even recognize a more fundamental inequality in all capitalist societies in all times: between the vast majority who have to perform what Marx called “alienated labor” to secure the means of subsistence for themselves and their families and the privileged few who can engage in creative, satisfying work.

In the preface to The Rise and Fall of American Growth, Gordon recounts that his interest in the changing rates of economic growth and labor productivity over the course of U.S. history goes back to his days as a graduate student in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid 1960s. The research for this book was undertaken to satisfy his intellectual curiosity, not because he had to do so to earn a living. But very few people have the luxury of working to satisfy their intellectual curiosity or express their creative impulses.

Consider, for example, the employees of Princeton University Press, who transformed Gordon’s manuscript into the printed pages of a book. True, they use technology that is radically different from that used by their predecessors in the 1920s, who set type for books by prominent academic economists of the time like Irving Fisher and Wesley C. Mitchell. And they work in more comfortable facilities. Nonetheless, they do the same kind of work for the same personal reason, to earn a livelihood.

Reading Gordon’s book, one would conclude that the 40-hour workweek and 11-plus-month work year, as in the U.S., is the highest possible level of organized society with regard to the necessary labor time expended by its members. However, in a planned socialist economy it would be possible, through a progressive, self-reinforcing increase in labor productivity, to radically reduce the total labor time necessary to produce both the means of production and articles of consumption. Within no more than a few generations, people would only be working, say, 20 hours a week and six months a year. Everyone would then have both the available time and access to material and cultural resources to acquire the scientific and technological knowledge that is now the province of a privileged elite. Projecting a future communist society, Marx wrote more than a century and a half ago:

“Free time—which is both leisure and time for higher activity—has naturally transformed its possessor into another subject; and it is then as this other subject that he enters into the immediate production process. This process is simultaneously discipline, with respect to the developing human being, and application, experimental science, material creative and self-objectifying science, with respect to the developed man, whose mind is the repository of the accumulated knowledge of society.”

—“Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy” (1857-58)

In a future communist society, there would be a vast expansion of the number of people capable of developing technological innovations on the order of Gordon’s heroes of the past, like Thomas Edison, Karl Benz (inventor of the automobile) and Guglielmo Marconi (a developer of the radio).

World War II: An Instance of State Capitalism

For Marxists, the most valuable part of Gordon’s book is his analysis of the “great leap forward” in labor productivity that occurred during the Second World War (1939-45) and carried into the first few decades of the postwar era. Gordon concludes: “World War II saved the U.S. economy from secular stagnation, and a hypothetical scenario of economic growth after 1939 that does not include the war looks dismal at best.” This was the one moment in modern American history when the expansion of productive facilities embodying new, more advanced technologies was not determined by the profit-making calculations of corporate executives and Wall Street financiers. In order to defeat its capitalist-imperialist enemies, the U.S. government—the executive agency of the American ruling class as a whole—directed and financed the unprecedented construction of industrial plant and equipment.

A standard economic history of the Second World War states:

“The period 1940 to 1944 saw a greater expansion of industrial production in the United States than any previous period.... Between 1940 and 1944 the total output of manufactured goods increased 300 per cent and that of raw materials by about 60 per cent. Investment in new plant and equipment, much of it direct investment by the government, is estimated to have increased the productive capacity of the economy by as much as 50 per cent.”

—Alan S. Milward, War, Economy and Society 1939-1945 (1977)

Government-funded factories and other productive facilities were turned over free of charge to corporate capitalists, thereby greatly increasing their profits both during and after the war. Gordon comments in this regard: “Though private capital input stagnated during 1930-45, the amount of capital input financed by the government surged ahead throughout that fifteen-year interval. Of particular interest was the creation of new plant facilities paid for by the government but operated by private firms to produce military equipment and supplies.”

Franklin D. Roosevelt and the other political directors of the U.S. imperialist state (for example, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau) were intimately familiar with the workings of industrial corporations and banks. They knew from firsthand experience that they could not depend on the normal mechanisms of the capitalist market to maximize the output of armaments in the shortest possible time. Big industrialists like Henry Ford and Henry Kaiser were therefore guaranteed profits through the cost-plus method of setting procurement prices. Their firms were paid whatever they claimed it cost them to build battleships, bombers, tanks, etc., with an additional markup for profit. Over the course of the war, the after-tax profits of industrial firms increased by 120 percent.

Far more important in its long-term economic effects was direct government financing of the construction of factories and other industrial infrastructure. Gordon emphasizes that the number of machine tools—the core component of an industrial economy—doubled from 1940 to 1945, and “almost all of these new machine tools were paid for by the government rather than by private firms.” Ford’s gigantic bomber-building plant in Willow Run, Michigan, was government-financed. Likewise were major pipelines, still in use today, conveying petroleum from the Texas oil fields to the Northeast. Moreover, the basic technology underlying what Gordon termed the “third industrial revolution,” beginning in the 1960s, also originated in the U.S. military during the Second World War. The prototype of the mainframe computer, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was developed by scientists and engineers, employed by the war department, at the University of Pennsylvania.

When the American capitalist-imperialist state maximized production, labor productivity and technological innovation, it was in order to bring death and destruction to other peoples. Arguably the most important scientific and technological breakthrough in the 20th century, the unleashing of nuclear energy, was used to incinerate the civilian populations of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Gordon Versus the “Techno-Optimists”

Gordon’s main foil in his book is an intellectual current he deems “techno-optimists,” who foresee new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence placing the American economy on the cusp of a wave of economic growth. Like Gordon, these techno-optimists (including Joel Mokyr, Gordon’s colleague at Northwestern University, as well as Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT, among others) believe that it is technological innovation above all else that determines the course of society. The dispute involves two very different questions. One concerns the sphere of consumption in the present, the other the sphere of production in the future.

Gordon argues that the effect of the new information and communications technologies on the quality of everyday life has been relatively meager compared to the major innovations and inventions in the century between 1870 and 1970. Those ranged from indoor plumbing, electric lighting and central heating to automobiles, airplanes and television. Gordon writes:

“Though there has been continuous innovation since 1970, it has been less broad in its scope than before, focused on entertainment and information and communication technology (ICT), and advances in several dimensions of the standard of living related to food, clothing, appliances, housing, transportation, health, and working conditions have advanced at a slower pace than before 1970.”

At another level, the dispute between Gordon and the techno-optimists is over the “futurology” of the likelihood of dramatically transformative new technologies developing and being put into widespread use in the near future. Both sides implicitly treat capitalism as a system that best fosters technological innovation. Both, of course, write off the perspective of a collectivized planned economy as not meriting serious consideration.

In a 2014 essay titled “The Next Age of Invention: Technology’s Future Is Brighter than Pessimists Allow,” Mokyr rhapsodizes about supercomputers, 3-D printing, genetic engineering and the like. There is, however, no mention of wages, production costs, markets or profits. These basic categories determining capitalist production and investment in new technologies are likewise absent from his brief polemical response to Gordon’s recent book, “Is Our Economic Future Behind Us?” (29 November 2016). In the unlikely event that Mokyr becomes CEO of Apple or General Electric, these companies would likely face bankruptcy. If he followed his own prescriptions, Mokyr would use the most advanced and therefore most expensive equipment, irrespective of whether this elevated production costs above those of competing firms.

In his 2014 essay, Mokyr does advance an economic argument in the service of techno-optimism: “A second reason technological progress will continue unabated has to do with the emergence of a competitive global marketplace, which will encourage the spread of new technology from its originating locations to other users who do not wish to be left behind.” In fact, the extension of international trade and capital export hardly represents an unambiguous encouragement to the development of technology. In the imperialist epoch, the international economy runs up against the very nation-states upon which the imperialists base their power, constituting an obstacle to the further development of humanity’s productive forces. Production in Europe, Japan and some spots in Asia may use modern methods. However, the vast pool of cheap labor available in South and East Asia and Latin America tends to inhibit investment in laborsaving technology in both the Third World and the imperialist centers.

When U.S. and European industrial firms shift manufacturing operations to poor countries, they often tend to use less capital-intensive methods of production. Consider clothing manufacture. While the technology exists to perform this in capital-intensive, highly automated plants, it remains cheaper for companies to pay workers in oppressed neocolonies like Bangladesh pennies on the dollar to sew clothing in conditions that are closer to those of the 19th century than the 21st.

In First World countries, too, current scientific and technological knowledge is not used in a rational and socially beneficial way, and in many cases is willfully misused. Consider the field of medical research, where major efforts are made to treat baldness and erectile dysfunction while only a pittance is invested in new drugs and vaccines for potentially fatal tropical diseases.

In the U.S. alone, some 23,000 people die every year of infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A study commissioned by the British government reported that by midcentury as many as ten million people a year globally could die from drug-resistant bacteria if new treatments are not discovered. Yet despite the critical social need, most of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies long ago stopped developing new antibiotics, citing low returns on investment.

Likewise, some 25 million people in the U.S. suffer from so-called rare diseases, such as Lou Gehrig’s disease and cystic fibrosis as well as sickle cell anemia, which overwhelmingly affects black people. Yet investment in research on treatments and cures for such diseases is notoriously meager, even though rare-disease research has often uncovered fruitful pathways for treating and curing some of the most prevalent ailments. The Center for Health Journalism at the University of Southern California explained the reluctance of pharmaceutical companies: “Most say investing in treatments for rare diseases—ones that affect tens of thousands of people—does not make for good business sense.”

Disregarding the laws governing the capitalist mode of production, Mokyr, McAfee, Brynjolfsson & Co. project a quantum leap in productivity in the near future through the use of “brilliant technologies.” Gordon implicitly accepts the limitations of the capitalist system in denying the very possibility of such a development. With regard to robotics, he writes: “The exponential increase in computer speed and memory has apparently raced far ahead of the capability of robots to duplicate human movements.” Gordon offers no argument for why this gap could not be greatly reduced by future advances in scientific and technological knowledge. He makes no assessment of the resources currently expended on robotics research.

Most of the vast amount of scientific research conducted by universities is directly funded by the federal government, and the biggest chunk of federal funding is directed toward military ends. The U.S. budget last year directed $6.5 billion in R&D to the National Science Foundation, while the R&D budget of the Air Force alone totaled almost $27 billion. Research in the physical sciences, including robotics, even if at some layers of remove, tends toward the ultimate end of building better drones and other machinery to blow up things and kill people in the interests of capitalist imperialism. Mathematics funding tends toward algorithms for securing state secrets and operations while hacking into the secrets of others. The National Security Agency is widely thought to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the U.S.

At every turn, despite its thirst for technological innovation, capitalism is not the ally of scientific advance but its opponent. From intellectual property laws and the perverse incentives of the market to the tens of billions spent on more effective weaponry, capitalism directs research in the interests of the ruling class and its state apparatus. If those same resources were directed toward advancing human knowledge, furthering human happiness and putting mankind in control of its destiny, what could be accomplished is nearly unimaginable. This requires overturning the capitalist-imperialist system through a series of proletarian revolutions, laying the basis for a globally planned socialist economy. It is to lead the proletariat in that fight that the International Communist League seeks to reforge the Fourth International, world party of socialist revolution.

Ideologues of Decaying Capitalism The Bankruptcy of Liberal Economists

By Joseph Seymour and Bruce André

(Part One)

“This expropriation [of capitalist property] will make it possible for the productive forces to develop to a tremendous extent. And when we see how incredibly capitalism is already retarding this development, when we see how much progress could be achieved on the basis of the level of technique already attained, we are entitled to say with the fullest confidence that the expropriation of the capitalists will inevitably result in an enormous development of the productive forces of human society.” [emphasis in original]

—V.I. Lenin, The State and Revolution (1917)

Lenin thus summarized Karl Marx’s fundamental critique of the capitalist system as well as the ultimate goal of socialism. Marxists gauge human progress by the development of mankind’s productive forces, from the stone tools of primitive society to present-day science, technology and the modern factory. With the advent and development of industrial capitalism beginning in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, one could envisage for the first time a future end to scarcity and class divisions. However, the private ownership of the means of production increasingly acted as a brake on the further development of the productive forces, not least through periodic economic crises. The emergence of modern imperialism at the end of the 19th century marked the onset of an epoch of global capitalist decay. The major capitalist powers, having divided the world through imperial conquest, embarked on a series of wars for its redivision, seeking to expand their colonial holdings and spheres of domination at the expense of their rivals.

The goal of proletarian revolution is to resolve the contradiction at the heart of capitalism, in which production for private profit stifles overall productive growth. Collectivizing the means of production and making the bounty of society available to all, a workers state will organize all of industry in the way that an individual assembly line is today conceived: according to a rational plan. An international socialist economy, by applying scientific planning to the entire economic system, will unleash a qualitative development of the productive forces and of labor productivity. This will liberate the productive capacities of mankind, ultimately eliminating economic scarcity and, with that, laying the material basis for the disappearance of classes and the withering away of the state.

In contrast to that Marxist view, the equation of capitalism with unlimited economic growth was an article of faith for bourgeois economists of the post-World War II generation. Today, that faith has largely faded. In the eyes of liberal economists, the meager rate of economic growth experienced in the U.S. in the past few decades has become the “new normal.” Lawrence Summers, a key economic operator in the Bill Clinton administration in the 1990s, sees the advanced capitalist countries as having entered a prolonged period of “secular stagnation,” reviving a notion that originated among liberal Keynesians like Alvin Hansen during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

That view was reflected in the 2016 presidential election as Hillary Clinton offered nothing except more of the same—“America is great”—with maybe some minor tinkering. Even her left-liberal (“progressive”) Democratic Party challenger Bernie Sanders did not claim that his policies would lead to a substantial boost in economic output but only that they would bring about a somewhat more equitable redistribution of income. Right-wing demagogue Donald Trump promoted the patent lie that he would double the current annual rate of economic growth from 2 percent to 4 percent, or even triple it.

Now, Trump and the Republican-dominated Congress, resurrecting Ronald Reagan’s supply-side economics, have pushed through a massive tax cut for corporations and the ultrarich. The idea that the benefits resulting from tax breaks for the wealthy will “trickle down” to the rest of the population in the form of increased investment, more jobs and higher wages is even more ludicrous today than it was in the 1980s, when it was the centerpiece of Reaganomics. American businesses are already sitting on an unprecedented stockpile of more than $2.4 trillion in cash. Apple and General Motors are hoarding almost 30 percent of their total value in cash. Why are companies not investing those staggering sums in new plants, machinery and additional workers? The obvious answer is that they lack confidence that such investment would generate an acceptable rate of return.

Meanwhile, the Democrats do not even pretend to offer a policy alternative that might significantly increase the rate of growth. Paul Krugman, probably the country’s best-known “progressive” economist because of his regular column in the New York Times, defended Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign on the grounds that government policy has little effect on economic growth, a supposedly mysterious process beyond the ken of his profession to understand, much less change:

“What do we know about accelerating long-run growth? According to the [Congressional] budget office, potential growth was pretty stable from 1970 to 2000, with nothing either Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton did making much obvious difference. The subsequent slide began under George W. Bush and continued under Mr. Obama. This history suggests no easy way to change the trend.”

—New York Times, 15 August 2016

The Falling Rate of Profit

A recent, book-length version of the “there’s not much we can do about economic growth” school of thought is Marc Levinson’s An Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy (2016). A former economics and finance editor of the Economist, house organ of Anglo-American bankers, Levinson strikes a contrarian pose, gleefully debunking the economic policy doctrines of both wings of the bourgeois political spectrum: Keynesianism on the left and monetarism and supply-side economics on the right. He contends that the relatively high rates of growth experienced by the advanced capitalist countries in the three decades after World War II amounted to a fortuitous historical accident that cannot be replicated by any kind of government policy.

A much weightier expression (in every respect) of historical pessimism with regard to the American economy is a recent book by a prominent liberal academic economist, Robert J. Gordon, The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War (2016). Unlike An Extraordinary Time, which has a slapdash, journalistic quality, Gordon’s book (a 700-plus-page tome) is a work of serious scholarship. While Gordon’s argumentation differs somewhat from that of Levinson, as does the historical scope of his study, his conclusion is basically the same:

“This is a book about the drama of a revolutionary century when, through a set of miracles, economic growth accelerated, the modern world was created, and then after that creation the potential for future inventions having a similar impact on everyday life of necessity was inevitably diminished. The implications for the future of U.S. and world economic growth could not be more profound....

“The economic revolution of 1870 to 1970 was unique in human history, unrepeatable because so many of its achievements could happen only once.”

Gordon’s use of the term “miracles” underscores his belief that mere mortals cannot consciously control the quantity and content of the material wealth created by their labor.

In the introductory section of An Extraordinary Time, Levinson defends Obama against a charge leveled by right-wing scribe George F. Will, who stated: “Making slow growth normal serves the progressive program of defining economic failure down.” To this Levinson replies, “as if the rate of economic growth were a matter of presidential discretion.” It is, of course, true that in capitalist America the policies of a given administration usually have a marginal effect on economic growth.

The expansion (or contraction) of the production of marketable goods and services under capitalism is mainly determined by the extent to which the executives of large corporations and Wall Street financiers invest profits in new productive facilities, especially those embodying more advanced (labor-saving) technologies. What drives capitalist investment is not the impulse to maximize output or labor productivity but rather to maximize the rate of profit (i.e., the ratio of profit to the market value of the means of production).

However, Marx, in one of his key insights, demonstrated that there is an inherent tendency for the rate of profit, the driving force of the capitalist system, to decline over time. By prompting capitalists to cut back their investments, a falling rate of profit generates periodic crises, usually triggered in financial markets. The result is a contraction of output and increased unemployment.

Marx’s explanation for the falling tendency of the rate of profit flowed from his understanding that surplus value—the unpaid portion of workers’ labor—is the source of profit, not the capitalists’ expenditures on the means of production (e.g., machinery and raw materials). Marx observed that especially in periods of economic boom, when workers can feel emboldened to demand higher wages, individual capitalists invest an increased amount of capital in plant upgrades and such in order to cut labor costs. By doing so, the capitalist gains a competitive advantage. However, as all capitalists follow suit, the total amount of surplus value generated per amount of capital invested—i.e., the average profit rate—declines.

Capitalists invest in expanding productive capacity on the assumption that they will be able to sell the goods produced at a particular rate of profit. However, as the profit rate drops, they find themselves unable to sell their products at the expected profit rate. They cut back investments and slash production, resulting in an economic downturn. Workers are thrown out onto the street; entire factories become rusted relics.

Bourgeois economic ideologues, from Keynesians to monetarists and supply-siders, identify the laws governing the capitalist mode of production with the laws governing production as such. In the absence of a revolutionary working-class alternative, the appeal of Trump’s right-wing populist demagogy is enhanced by the fact that both liberals, like Krugman and Gordon, as well as centrists on the bourgeois political spectrum, like Summers and Levinson, insist that it is not possible to overcome the decades-long stagnation in the living standards of American working people.

From Kennedy’s “New Economics” to Obama’s “New Normal”

In the past, Democratic politicians, especially those on the more liberal wing of the party, promised to deliver a new era of economic prosperity. John F. Kennedy’s successful 1960 presidential campaign against Richard Nixon, who had been vice president in the Republican Eisenhower administration (1953-61), was dominated by Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union and fears among the ruling class that the U.S. was falling behind in science and technology. In its economic message, Kennedy’s campaign resembled Trump’s. His platform called for boosting economic growth and dynamism under the slogan “Let’s get this country moving again.” He pointed to the sluggish economic performance, punctuated by two recessions, during Eisenhower’s second term. In this respect, the campaign tactics used by Kennedy against Nixon and Eisenhower were similar to those used by Trump against Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

In An Extraordinary Time, Levinson retrospectively criticizes liberal Keynesians like Walter Heller, chief economic adviser to both the Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations. Heller claimed that fiscal policy (taxation and government expenditure) could be fine-tuned so as to maintain full employment and maximize economic growth. By the late 1970s, Democratic politicians and their intellectual apologists were singing a different, more downbeat, tune.

Capitalizing on the downfall of Nixon resulting from the Watergate scandal, in 1977 Jimmy Carter, a centrist Southern Democrat (like Bill Clinton), entered the White House. A few years later, the hapless Carter administration confronted an unusual condition termed “stagflation”: rapidly rising prices combined with a recession. Levinson describes the widespread economic insecurity that propelled the right-wing Republican Reagan to the presidency in 1981: “The conservative ascendance came only as mortgage interest rates above 11 percent made young people despair of ever buying a home and as layoff notices went out to ironworkers on construction sites and toolmakers in auto plants.”

Surveying those dismal times, a mainstream liberal academic economist, Lester C. Thurow, published a book in 1980 on the state of the U.S. economy titled The Zero-Sum Society: Distribution and the Possibilities for Economic Change. As indicated by the title, Thurow argued that it was no longer possible to substantially increase the size of the economic pie so that everyone would get a somewhat bigger piece. Economic policy now involved recutting the existing pie such that some people would get a larger slice and others a smaller one:

“For most of our problems there are several solutions. But all these solutions have the characteristic that someone must suffer large economic losses. No one wants to volunteer for this role, and we have a political process that is incapable of forcing anyone to shoulder this burden. Everyone wants someone else to suffer the necessary economic losses, and as a consequence none of the possible solutions can be adopted.”

In fact, the almost four decades since Thurow wrote those lines have seen an unremitting war by the bourgeoisie to force workers, minorities and the poor to “suffer the necessary economic losses” to bolster capitalist profits. That one-sided war on workers has been facilitated by the trade-union bureaucracy, which maneuvers for crumbs while peddling a mythical “partnership” of labor with the bosses and their parties, particularly Democrats who falsely pose as “friends of labor.”

Technological Innovation and Capitalist Investment

The main theme of Levinson’s An Extraordinary Time is that economic growth, based on increasing labor productivity through technological innovation, is impervious to government policy. After listing several explanations offered by academic economists for the slower growth of labor productivity in the advanced capitalist countries since the 1970s, Levinson concludes:

“None of these explanations sufficed to explain the productivity bust afflicting countries with vastly different economies and divergent approaches to economic policy. The more deeply the scholars mined the data, the more confused they became. What the data could not yet show was that the world had moved to a new stage of economic growth, one that would develop in a far different way....

“Future advances in well-being would depend heavily on developing innovations and putting them to effective use.”

The last statement is manifestly true. Increases in labor productivity under capitalism are determined by two main factors: the extent to which capitalists invest their profits in new productive facilities (plant and equipment) embodying more advanced technology and the degree to which the new technology increases output per unit of labor input.

Levinson does recognize a causal link between the slowdown in the growth of labor productivity and a decline in the rate of capital investment:

“Across the wealthy economies, business investment, which had increased an average of 5.6 percent per year between 1960 and 1973, grew at a far slower rate, barely 4 percent per year, for the next two decades. Sluggish investment left steel mills operating antiquated blast furnaces and insurance offices using high-speed computer printers to spit out form upon form for clerks to organize in file cabinets. Technological innovations usually arrive in the business world incorporated in new equipment and facilities. With firms deferring such investments at every turn, their workers’ productivity improved at less than half the rate in the decades after 1973 as in the decades before.”

However, Levinson makes no effort to explain why the rate of investment has declined to such an extent. In particular, he does not consider the interrelationship between capital investment, technological innovation and the rate of profit.

As Marx underlined, capitalists will invest in new facilities incorporating more advanced technology if, and only if, they believe the increase in profit per worker will be greater than the increased market value of capital per worker. If capitalists discover that their investments are not generating a competitive rate of profit, they will halt or cut back their investments, often triggering an economic downturn.

Marx thus proved that capitalist production increasingly puts the brakes on historical development, at the same time that it creates capitalism’s own gravedigger, the proletariat. He and Friedrich Engels explained that the only way to end the boom-bust cycles inherent to capitalism is for the working class to take control of the means of production through socialist revolution and institute a planned, collectivized economy.

"Delving into the ""uncool"" side of BDSM, and how to stop wanting it",Liberal,7,7qrien,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/7qrien/delving_into_the_uncool_side_of_bdsm_and_how_to/,1,"Hello everyone, I'm a psychologist and I have been studying since 2010 about psychopathology, and the relevance of childhood experiences in adulthood. But this post will be both a confession and a bit of a case study.   
I wasn't born in the US, I was born in South America, and there hate crimes against women are 10 fold worse than it is in southern US. Rapes and violence against women happen every minute. To add to this already not so nice social atmosphere, I can only describe my childhood as having lived and survived relentless torture, psychological, physical and for a brief period sexual torture. Systematic, daily and for no reason, except partially because I was born female.   
I grew up sorta uninterested in relationships this life had made me standoffish and aloof, also I'd wear modest clothes with no cleavage, and loose, the sexual assault made me disgusted of my own body and I didn't want anyone to look at my ""form"" the thought of someone wanting my body was terrifying to me. 
Fast forward to the time I was exploring online porn, after my 20s, I'd end up looking at quite kinky stuff, BDSM, degrading scenes, with punishment and such. Why was I attracted to this kind of thing? To be frank I rather had ignored it for a while, but guilt and the feeling I deserved to be treated like sh*t was the core reason for it. And the feeling women needed to be submissive to men. After watching it I felt disgusted and sad.  
It was just not a healthy thing, so in order to stop this ""preference"" my mind seem to have & my sense of justice disagreed with, I went on watch a couple of these things, this time, I placed myself in these women shoes, I thought of ""what if my partner actually did this to me?"", What if it was a stranger, what are these ""actresses"" really feeling. >>Were they abused too?? Do they just need the money desperately.   
I can promise you that will ruin basically any porn for almost anyone, because it did for me, also realizing I was just re-experiencing all the traumas from my awful childhood. I did not hate or blame myself for having liked it. In a way finding that I had an attraction to it made me understand myself better and getting rid of that attraction together with realizing what it represented was truly amazing. 

I'm no longer a kinky person, I no longer want h porn, not because I am denying myself a pleasure, rather than there's no pleasure to get from it. Today I enjoy my sessions of cuddly sex with my partner and it's more and better than any kinky act could ever give me. Sometimes we just cuddle and fall asleep in each other's arms. It is so sweet and nurturing & there's no moral hangover or guilt after, only joy.

TLDR REFLECTIONS: maybe BDSM is not as liberating for some as they try to paint it as, be watchful of what that makes you feel after you're no longer horny. Why does that position of helplessness and submission (or domination) attracts you so much & what can you learn about your own emotional and psychological universe through sexual preferences (or paraphilias). What does it tell you about how you see yourself and what position you put yourself in, in the dynamic of a sexual exchange?   
   
I hope this has sparkled a sense of curiosity in some of you and please know that you don't need to be ashamed. But every now and then ask yourself if what you are doing, is building you up or tearing you down. I wish I have shed some light into the non pretty side of why some people like BDSM, I cannot answer FOR anyone why they do, but I hope I have made the right questions so that they can find, if there's any of you here. 

Peace :)",1516099377.0
LOOKING FOR: Red Pilled Radical Feminists (or just to chat),Liberal,6,7q7hdf,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/7q7hdf/looking_for_red_pilled_radical_feminists_or_just/,2,"No, I'm not a troll. I'm just a woman who discovered radical feminism many years ago and found it not only comforting but life-changing. It changed the way I perceived other women (regardless of my opinion on them or if I got along with them) and it helped me realise my sexuality. However, over the years I've become more and more disillusioned - not just with radical feminism, but with general leftist activism in general. While I still agree with all radical feminist ideology, in particular when it comes to the root of sexism, on the issue of pornography and prostitution, etc, I find myself stepping further away from it and many other popular leftist forms of ideology (such as supporting BLM or Antifa or communism). 

The way I've started to think about it is like this: When it comes to oppression (of women in particular) there are two things that matter: laws put in place specifically to keep certain groups of people from having certain rights; and social stigma. These things usually go hand in hand, but I believe they need to be developed both together as well as separately. It's not just a matter of putting laws in place and wiping our hands of it, nor is it just a matter of changing people's minds without any legal backing. For example, gay marriage laws. It's fine to pass the law so no gays or lesbians suffer repercussions for attempting to marry who we love, but then if the general population still has a conservative mindset, what does that help?

I'm getting a bit off-topic here... what I mean is, I personally feel like it doesn't make sense to talk about oppression anymore if we include everything from what happens to women in countries like Saudi Arabia to how a woman in Sweden is stigmatized for having been a prostitute. The difference between the two is both law and society. In the first example, you not only have law preventing women in Saudi Arabia (and other countries) from having freedom, but you also have society at large preventing them from it. In the second, you don't have any laws that may harm a prostituted woman in Sweden, but you do still have some social stigma against her.

I don't think these are comparable. The former I would truly call oppression (and other sex-based oppressions, such as FGM, femicide, child brides) while the other I'd categorize as  prejudice. I hope I'm getting my point across.. I'm truly just trying to look for someone to talk to, because I feel like I've fallen between the floorboards. I have never found any allies in the left since I found radical feminism, but neither do I see myself with the right.

I'm curious if anyone else has been having any ""bad"" thoughts we're not really supposed to voice, or maybe someone just wants to talk about this. Or I'll get banned for questioning this, you never know...",1515879837.0

When was the last time the media threw 100% of its support behind one party’s presidential candidate? - by Mike Whitney,Liberal,3,58eaz6,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/58eaz6/when_was_the_last_time_the_media_threw_100_of_its/,0,"The ruling class unanimously backs Hillary Clinton, that much is obvious.

“For any minimally conscious American citizen, it is absolutely evident that Donald Trump is not only facing the mammoth Clinton political machine, but, also the combined forces of the viciously dishonest Mainstream Media.” -Boyd D. Cathey, “The Tape, the Conspiracy, and the Death of the Old Politics”, Unz Review

“The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary.” -Donald Trump, Twitter

When was the last time the media threw 100% of its support behind one party’s presidential candidate? What does that say about the media?

Do you feel comfortable with the idea that a handful of TV and print-news executives are inserting themselves into the process and choosing our leaders for us? Is that the way democracy is supposed to work?

Check out this blurb from The Hill:

“The broadcast evening news programs ABC, NBC and CBS covered allegations against Trump by several women who claim he sexually assaulted them for more than 23 minutes on Thursday night. But revelations in the WikiLeaks dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta which included…sympathy for Wall Street, advocation for open borders and blatant examples of media collusion ….got a whole 1 minute and 7 seconds combined.” Ratio of negative coverage of Trump to Clinton: 23:1

In print on Thursday, it was no better. The New York Times had 11 negative stories on Trump…But zero on Clinton/WikiLeaks. Ratio: 11:0.” (Media and Trump bias; Not even trying to hide it anymore, The Hill)

The article in The Hill also refers to a survey by the Washington Post and ABC News that asks participants six questions about allegations of sexual misconduct by Trump, but zero questions about Podesta’s incriminating emails.

Is that what you call “balance”?

I should state out-front, that I don’t plan to vote for either candidate, Trump or Clinton, so my claims of “bias” are not grounded in support for one candidate or the other. I am simply ticked-off by the fact that the media honchos have pulled out all the stops and are inserting themselves in the process to produce the outcome they want.

That’s what you call “rigging” an election. When you turn on Washington Week (Gwen Ifil) on public TV and see an assembled panel of six pundits–three conservatives and three liberals–and all six turn out to love Hillary and hate Trump; you can be reasonably certain that the election is rigged, because that’s what rigging is. Rather than providing background information about the candidate’s position on the issues so voters can make an informed decision, the media uses opinionmakers to heap praise on one candidate while savagely denigrating the other. The obvious goal is to shape public opinion in the way that best suits the interests of the people who own the media and who belong to the establishment of rich and powerful elites who run the country, the 1 percent. In this case, the ruling class unanimously backs Hillary Clinton, that much is obvious.

Fortunately, the tide is turning on the mainstream media as people look to other, more reliable sources for their information. It should come as no surprise that people are more distrustful of media than ever before and that that a great many feel that the media is conducting a brutal class war against ordinary working people. Surely, anyone who has followed economic developments at all in the last seven years, knows that the policies of the Fed have created a yawning chasm between rich and poor that is only getting worse as long as the levers of power stay in the hands of establishment politicians. Hillary Clinton is certainly the worst of these establishment politicos. Aside from being the most widely-reviled candidate the Democrats have ever nominated, she is the embodiment of political corruption and cronyism. How is it, you may ask, that someone like Clinton was able to nab “upwards of $225,000 per speech” from Goldman Sachs if she wasn’t influence peddling?

Does it really matter what she said in these speeches?

Not to me. The huge sums of money prove beyond any reasonable doubt that Clinton is selling access, tacitly agreeing to “go easy” on the big Wall Street investment banks provided they keep her foundation’s coffers overflowing. What other possible explanation could there be?

Do as many Americans know about Hillary’s sordid dealings with Wall Street as know about Trump’s “alleged” sexual dalliances?

Of course not. It’s not even close.

Do they know that Clinton was the driving force behind the intervention in Libya and Syria, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have died and seven million have been internally displaced? Do they know she was involved in the toppling of a democratically-elected government in Honduras or that a number of prominent neocons, who dragged the US into war in Iraq based on WMD lies, now support her?

Nope.

Do people know that Hillary had proof that ISIS –America’s arch enemy– was being funded and supported by our allies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar and, yet, she never reported the news to the American people??

Here’s a damning clip from one of the Podesta emails:

“We need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to Isis and other radical groups in the region.”

Remember when George W. Bush said that ‘We will treat the terrorists and the people who support the terrorists the same”?

Hillary must not have gotten that memo or we would have bombed Riyadh by now.

Do people know that there has never been a war that Hillary didn’t support, a job-killing “free trade” bill she didn’t back, or a civil liberties-eviscerating piece of legislation (Clinton voted for the original USA PATRIOT Act in 2001, as well as the revised version in 2006.) she wasn’t eager to sign?

Oh, but she does support “women’s reproductive rights” which makes her a big champion of personal freedom among her narrow demographic of successful, educated, white women. Excuse me, for not doing handstands.

Here’s another short clip from the WSWS:

“Hillary and Bill Clinton have accumulated a total of $153 million in speaking fees since Bill Clinton left the White House. Only the very naïve could believe that these vast sums were paid for the speeches themselves. They were payment for services rendered to the American financial aristocracy over a protracted period.” (In secret Goldman Sachs speeches, Clinton explains why the rich should rule, World socialist Web Site)

Get the picture? Hillary Clinton isn’t a candidate, she’s a franchise, a walking ATM machine. And her shady Foundation is nothing more than a vast recycling bin for illicit funds that pour into the political sausage-making machine in the form of contributions and magically transform themselves into special favors for the billionaire class.

Is the system rigged?

You’re damn right it is! Check this out from Zero Hedge under the heading of “73% Of Republicans Say Election Could Be “Stolen” As Trump Slams “Rigged Elections”:

“A Politico/Morning Consult Poll found that 41% of registered voters say that the election cold be stolen from Trump while 73% of Republicans fear the same.

The American electorate has turned deeply skeptical about the integrity of the nation’s election apparatus, with 41 percent of voters saying November’s election could be “stolen” from Donald Trump due to widespread voter fraud.

The new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll — conducted among 1,999 registered voters Oct. 13 through Oct. 15 — shows that Trump’s repeated warnings about a “rigged” election are having effect: 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be swiped from him. Just 17 percent of Democrats agree with the prospect of massive fraud at the ballot box.” (Zero Hedge)

Should we be worried about the election being rigged? Should we be concerned that a significant number of Americans no longer trust the “integrity of the electoral process”?

And how are these allegations (that the election was stolen) going to impact Hillary’s ability to govern?

It’s going to impact it dramatically, in fact, it could stop her dead in her tracks. It could even precipitate a Constitutional crisis. And that’s where all this is headed, isn’t it?

Consider this: Maybe Trump isn’t really trying to win any more. Maybe he knows he can’t overcome a 12 point deficit this late in the game, so he’s going to pull a Samson. He’s going to shake the pillars and bring the whole rotten temple crashing down around him. He’s going use all his influence to discredit this fake democratic system the elites have painstakingly put together to control the public, he’s going to grow his throng of angry supporters into a small army, and he’s going to spearhead a (mainly) right wing populist movement that is going impose gridlock on Washington, deepen the political divisions, acrimony and polarization across the country, and make Clinton’s tenure as president a living hell.

That’s the gameplan. He’s going to marshal enough grassroots support that Clinton will spend her entire four years bogged down in endless investigations, fending off charges of criminal misconduct, and leap-frogging from one seedy scandal to the next.

No, Trump isn’t planning on winning. He doesn’t want to be president. He wants to be a modern-day Braveheart leading the peasants into battle against a thoroughly-corrupt and heinous ruling class establishment. That’s what he wants, and that’s why political has-beens like Gingrich and Giuliani have attached themselves to him like the plague. They see an opening for resurrecting their own dismal careers.

In any event, Hillary’s going to win the election, that’s for sure. But don’t count Trump out just yet. He’s just getting warmed up.

Workers of the World: Labor's Potential to Resist Capital is as Strong as Ever,Liberal,3,55utid,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/55utid/workers_of_the_world_labors_potential_to_resist/,0,"Trade unionists in the 1920s didn’t have much reason for optimism. Labor membership, which had shot upwards amid postwar unrest, crested and then plunged. Observers fretted that technological and cultural changes had rendered the labor movement obsolete and workers apathetic. “Our younger members, especially, have gone jazzy,” one union official lamented in the mid 1920s.

A decade later, strikes were blocking production across the country, and union density was skyrocketing.

After years of malaise in the labor movement, is a similar upsurge possible today?

Renowned labor scholar Beverly Silver thinks so. Chair of the sociology department at Johns Hopkins University, Silver has been a radical advocate for workers her whole life. Her award-winning work, including her pathbreaking Forces of Labor, deals with profound questions of labor, development, social conflict, and war. In a recent interview with Jacobin she explained what labor’s past can tell us about the present state — and future — of working-class struggle around the globe. The last few decades have seen a profound restructuring of the working class in the United States and other advanced capitalist countries. What are the broad contours of that restructuring process, and what are the forces driving it?

Capitalism is constantly transforming the organization of production and the balance of power between labor and capital — restructuring the working class, remaking the working class. So to answer this question I think we need to take a longer-term view.

It makes sense to go back to the mid-twentieth century — to the thirties, forties, and fifties. That’s when we first see the emergence of a very strong mass-production working class in the United States, most paradigmatically in the automobile industry but also in sectors like mining, energy, and transportation, which were central to industrialization and trade.

Pretty much right out of the gate after World War II, capital moved to restructure — reconfiguring the organization of production, the labor process, sources of labor supply, and the geographical location of production. This restructuring was in large part a response to strong labor movements in manufacturing and mining, in logistics and transportation.

An expanded version of David Harvey’s concept of the spatial fix is helpful here for understanding this restructuring. Capital tried to resolve the problem of strong labor movements, and the threat to profitability that labor posed, by implementing a series of “fixes.”

Companies utilized a spatial fix by moving to lower-wage sites. They implemented “technological fixes” — reducing their dependence on workers by accelerating automation. And they have been implementing what we can think of as a “financial fix” — moving capital out of trade and production and into finance and speculation as yet another means of reducing dependence on the established, mass-production working class for profits.

The beginnings of this shift of capital to finance and speculation was already visible in the 1970s, but it exploded after the mid 1990s, following the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act during the Clinton years.

So what looked like a sudden collapse in the power of organized labor in the United States in the eighties and nineties was actually rooted in decades of restructuring on these multiple fronts that began in the mid-twentieth century.

Of course, it is important to point out that there is another side of the coin. These capitalist fixes unmade the established mass-production working class, but they simultaneously made new working classes in the United States and elsewhere. These new working classes are emerging as the protagonists of labor struggles in many parts of the world today. It is no secret that the traditional forms of working-class organization, like trade unions in the United States and social-democratic parties in Europe, are in the midst of a severe crisis. How has capital succeeded in undermining and taming these organized expressions of working-class interest?

If we look back in history at high points of labor militancy, particularly those moments involving left movements tied to socialist and working-class parties, a recurrent set of strategies to undermine the radical potential of these movements is apparent. They can be summed up as restructuring, co-optation, and repression.

So, the kinds of restructuring or fixes I mentioned above — geographical relocation, technological change, financialization — certainly played an important role in weakening these movements. In the meantime, the co-optation of trade unions and working-class parties — their incorporation as junior partners into national hegemonic projects and social compacts — also played an important role. Finally, repression was an important part of the mix all along.

Just taking the United States as an example, in the post–World War II decades we see McCarthyism and the expulsion of left and Communist militants from the trade unions. Then, in the sixties and seventies, strong factory- and community-based movements of black workers — the Black Panther Party, the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) — were brought under control by out-and-out repression.

And today — with the militarization of local police forces and the endless “war on terror” creating a hostile environment for the mobilization of immigrant and black workers — coercion continues to play a major role. One of the big debates today is whether the defining dynamic shaping the global working class is exploitation — workers being squeezed at the point of production — or exclusion — workers being essentially locked out of stable wage labor. What are your thoughts on this debate?

I see them as equally important. Certainly it would be a mistake to write off the continuing importance of struggles against exploitation at the point of production. Indeed, one outcome of the spatial-fix strategy has been to create new working classes and labor-capital contradictions wherever capital goes.

In other words, workers’ resistance to exploitation at the point of production has followed the movement of capital around the globe over the past half-century. Indeed, we are witnessing the latest manifestation of this dynamic with the massive wave of labor unrest now taking place in China.

Once it became clear to corporations that simply moving factories to low-wage sites could not solve the problem of labor control, capital came to rely more heavily on automation and financialization. Automation, while hardly new, has recently been expelling wage workers from production at a rapid clip, increasing the visibility of the exclusionary dynamic. A recent glaring illustration is the news that FoxConn has actually followed through with its threat to introduce a massive number of robots into its factories in China.

Likewise, the movement of surplus capital into finance and speculation is also contributing in a major way to the increasing salience of exclusion. Finance — especially those financial activities that are not adjuncts to trade and production — absorbs relatively little wage labor; more importantly, it derives profits primarily from the regressive redistribution of wealth through speculation, rather than the creation of new wealth. Hence the link made by Occupy between obscene levels of class inequality and financialization.

Automation and financialization are leading to an acceleration in the long-term tendency of capitalism to destroy established livelihoods at a much faster rate than it creates new ones. This was always the predominant tendency of historical capitalism in much of the Global South, where dispossession tended to outpace the absorption of wage labor, and thus where workers increasingly had nothing to sell but their labor power, but little chance of actually selling it.

While this tendency is nothing new, both its acceleration and the fact that its negative effects are being felt in core countries — and not just in the Third World — help explain why the exclusionary dynamic has come to the fore in current debates. To frame the question differently, does it even make sense to think of exclusion and exploitation as separate processes?

Well, Marx certainly didn’t view them as separate phenomena. In the first volume of Capital, he argued that the accumulation of capital went hand in hand with the accumulation of a surplus population — that wealth was being created through exploitation, but at the same time big chunks of the working class were excluded or made superfluous to the needs of capital.

For most of the twentieth century, there was an uneven geographical distribution in terms of where the brunt of exclusionary processes was felt. Indeed, until recently, one of the ways capital maintained legitimacy within core countries was by pushing the weight of the exclusionary processes onto the Third World as well as onto marginalized sections of the working class within the core.

The world working class was divided, with boundaries very much defined by citizenship, race, ethnicity, and gender. Today these boundaries are still quite salient, however. Particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, the weight of exclusionary processes is being felt more heavily in core countries than in the past — with all sorts of political implications. In your work you’ve thought a lot about the power of workers and the working class. You distinguish between different sources of worker power. Can you talk more about that?

Yes, a major distinction is between structural power and associational power. Associational power is the capacity to make gains through trade union and political party organization. Structural power is the power that comes from workers’ strategic location within the process of production — a power that can be, and often has been, exercised in the absence of trade union organization. Why is it useful to make these distinctions?

Well, take structural power, for example. There are two main types of structural power: workplace bargaining power and marketplace bargaining power.

Most of the time, people think about marketplace bargaining power to understand worker power more broadly. If there’s high unemployment, your marketplace bargaining power is low, and vice versa. Workplace bargaining power — the ability to bring interconnected processes of production to a halt through localized work stoppages — is less emphasized, but is perhaps even more important for understanding sources of workers’ power today.

This is because, if you look at long-term historical trends, workers’ power at the point of production is undoubtedly, on balance, increasing. This is surprising to people. But this increased workplace bargaining power is apparent with the spread of just-in-time methods in manufacturing. In contrast to more traditional mass-production methods, no buffers or surpluses are built into the production process.

Thus, with the spread of just-in-time production in the automobile industry, for example, a relatively small number of workers, by simply stopping production in a strategic node — even, say, a windshield-wiper parts supplier — can bring an entire corporation to a standstill. There are plenty of recent examples of this in the automobile industry around the world.

Likewise, workers in logistics — transport and communication — have significant and growing workplace bargaining power tied to the cascading economic impact that stoppages in these sectors would have. Moreover, notwithstanding the almost universal tendency to think of globalization processes as weakening labor, the potential geographical scale of the impacts of these stoppages has increased with globalization. What about associational power? If workers have no unions or labor parties, doesn’t that undermine their structural bargaining power?

Not necessarily. Take the case of China. Autonomous trade unions are illegal, but there have been some major improvements recently in minimum-wage laws, labor laws, and working conditions. These changes have come out of a grassroots upsurge that has taken advantage of workers’ structural power, both in the marketplace and, even more important, in the workplace.

I think we also have to be honest about the ambiguous structural position of trade unions. If they’re too successful and deliver too much to their base, capital becomes extremely hostile and doesn’t want to deal with them and so moves to a more repressive strategy.

Capital will sometimes make deals with trade unions, but only if trade unions agree to play a mediating role, limiting labor militancy and ensuring labor control. But in order to effectively do that, unions have to deliver something to their base, which brings us back to the first problem. Ultimately, the question is: in what kind of situations does this contradictory dynamic between trade unions and capitalists play out to the benefit of workers? What do you think about arguments that struggles are shifting from the point of production to the streets or community?

This brings us back to the earlier question about the relative importance of exploitation and exclusion in shaping the world working class. Looking at the world working class as a whole today, I don’t think it would be accurate to say that struggles are shifting predominantly to the streets, especially if we are talking about struggles that have a serious disruptive impact on business as usual.

Struggles at the point of production continue to be an important component of overall world labor unrest. At the same time, the excluded — the unemployed and those with weak structural power — have no choice but to make their voices heard through direct action in the streets rather than direct action in the workplace.

The coexistence of struggles at the workplace and struggles in the street has been a feature of capitalism historically, as has the coexistence of exploitation and exclusion. Sometimes these two types of struggles proceed without intersecting in solidarity with each other, especially since, historically, the working class has been divided — both within countries and between countries — in the degree to which their experience is primarily shaped by the dynamics of exclusion or the dynamics of exploitation.

But if we think of major successful waves of labor unrest, they combined, in explicit or implicit solidarity, both of these kinds of struggles. Even the Flint factory occupation and subsequent 1936 and ’37 strike wave — a movement that was fundamentally based on leveraging workers’ power at the point of production — was made more potent by simultaneous struggles in the streets of unemployed workers and community solidarity.

Or, if we think of a recent mass movement that was widely seen as taking place almost entirely in the streets — Egypt in 2011 — it was when the Suez Canal workers leveraged their workplace bargaining power with a strike in support of the mass movement in the streets that Mubarak was forced to step down. It is also interesting to note that the April 6 youth movement that initiated the occupation of Tahrir Square was founded in 2008 to support a major strike by industrial workers.

So a fundamental problem for the Left today, which is also not new, is to figure out how to combine workplace bargaining power and the power of the street — to find the nodes of connection between unemployed, excluded, and exploited wage workers. This is almost certainly easier when the excluded and exploited are members of the same households or the same communities.

In the United States, we can see glimmers of these intersections with the 2015 dockworkers’ strike in California in support of Black Lives Matter mobilizations in the streets, and with the way the community and workplace struggles of immigrant workers intersect. In the United States today, it seems like a major focus of labor organizing and activism is on the lowest-wage workers in the service sectors. What do you make of this? Is this where we should be focusing our energies? Or should we be looking at different kinds of workers in different industries and sectors?

It’s not a mistake to place a big emphasis on these workers. If you’re going to raise the conditions of the majority of the population, you have to raise the conditions of these workers.

I think part of the skepticism inherent in this question is that so far this strategy hasn’t been very successful. Again, thinking about workplace bargaining power is useful here. At Walmart, for example, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to hit the retail side. You have to hit the distribution side.

The same goes for fast food. If you hit the distribution side, then you can leverage workplace bargaining power. Otherwise, you are left with a struggle that is confined to the streets. But this also leads us back to the question of how and when workers with strong workplace bargaining power exercise that power in support of broader transformational goals. Along with Giovanni Arrighi, you have argued that the trajectory of the workers’ movements in the United States and other national contexts are profoundly influenced by their relationship to broader movements in global politics, wars, and international conflicts. How have recent geopolitical shifts affected the strength of labor in the United States?

This is a very big and important question. I think a lot of the discussion of labor movements tends to focus on the economic side, but the geopolitical side is equally, if not more, important for understanding the prospects and possibilities for workers and workers’ movements, historically and going forward.

Fifteen years ago, right before September 11, it looked like we were on the verge of a mass upsurge of labor unrest in the United States, with a strong epicenter among immigrant workers. There were a number of major strikes that had been planned or were in progress, and then the dynamic shifted.

The war on terror gave a major boost to coercion and repression in maintaining the status quo, and not just in the workplace, in terms of employer hostility to trade unions, but more broadly, in terms of the impact of the permanent war environment on the prospects for organizing. Coercion and repression seem to be fundamental to capitalism. What’s different today in the relationship between workers, workers’ movements, and geopolitics?

Well, I think to answer this question it is important to place the current permanent war environment within the context of the broader crisis of US world power and hegemonic decline.

And we need to look at the long-term historical relationship between workers’ rights and the reliance of states on the working class to fight wars. Let’s discuss the latter first.

One of the well-known, but not widely discussed, roots of labor strength — or at least the institutionalization of trade unions and the deepening of democratic rights in the United States and in Western Europe, and to some extent globally — was the particular nature of war in the twentieth century, including the industrialization of the means of war and mass conscription.

To fight this type of war, the core powers, the imperial powers, needed the cooperation of the working class, both as soldiers fighting at the front and as workers keeping the factories going. War-making depended on industrial production for everything from armaments to boots. Hence the common wisdom during both world wars was that whoever kept the factories running would win the war.

In this context worker cooperation was key, and the relationship between war-making and civil unrest was unmistakable. The two biggest peaks of world labor unrest in the twentieth century, by far, were the years immediately following World War I and World War II. The troughs of labor unrest were in the midst of the wars themselves.

It’s also no coincidence that the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement was in the aftermath of World War II and the Korean War, and that the height of the Black Power Movement came during and after the Vietnam War.

States sought to secure the cooperation of workers through the mobilization of nationalist and patriotic sentiments, but this was not sustainable without tangible advances in workers’ rights. Thus, expansions of the welfare state went hand in hand with expansions of the warfare state in the twentieth century.

Put differently: working-class nationalism could only trump working-class internationalism if states showed that winning wars meant rising standards of living and expanding rights for workers as both workers and citizens. Do you think this is still the case today, in the context of seemingly permanent warfare?

The nature of war has changed today in many respects. Just like capital reorganized production in response to the strength of labor, so has the state restructured the military to lessen its dependence on workers and citizens to wage war.

The mass movement against the Vietnam War, and the refusal of soldiers at the front in Vietnam to go on fighting, was a turning point, triggering a fundamental restructuring of the organization and nature of war-making.

We see the results of this restructuring today with the end of mass conscription and the increasing automation of warfare. With the growing reliance on drones and other high-tech weaponry, US soldiers are being removed from direct danger — not entirely, but much more than in the past.

This is a different situation than the one that linked workers’ movements and warfare in the twentieth century. The welfare and warfare states have become uncoupled in the twenty-first century. Whether, under these changing conditions, working-class internationalism will trump working-class nationalism is a critical but unresolved question.

I have focused on the United States in this discussion, but the transformation in the nature of war-making has broader impacts. In the mid-twentieth century, many colonial countries were incorporated into the imperial war process as suppliers of both soldiers and materials for the war effort, leading to an analogous strengthening and militancy of the working class.

Today, in country after country in a wide swath of the Global South, you have a situation in which modern US war-making is leading to the wholesale disorganization and destruction of the working class in places where high-tech weaponry is being dropped. The current “migrant crisis,” both its roots and its repercussions, is a deeply disturbing blowback from this new age of war. In previous periods, rising tides of militancy and organization have tended to bring with them new and powerful organizational forms. In the nineteenth century it was the craft union, in the twentieth century it was the industrial union. Are these forms doomed to historical oblivion, and if so, what might replace them?

They’re certainly not doomed to historical oblivion. In the United States, for example, some of the most successful unions today — in terms of recruiting new members and militancy — are the ones that have their roots in the old AFL, in the craft-worker tradition. Some people say elements of that old organizing style are more suitable to the horizontal nature of current workplaces, rather than the industrial unions associated with vertically integrated corporations.

But this doesn’t mean industrial unions are dead, either. The types of successes that were characteristic of the classic CIO unions — the Flint sit-down strike in the engine plant and the strikes beyond that — relied on the strategic bargaining power of workers at the point of production. I think that there are still lessons to be learned from these successes.

Clearly neither of these forms succeeded in touching the fundamental problems of capitalism, however. As I already mentioned, the problem with trade unions is that, to the extent that they are too effective, capital and the state have no interest in working with them and cooperating.

Yet to the extent that they — and this is largely what’s happened — don’t deliver a serious transformation in the life and livelihoods of workers, they lose credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of workers themselves.

I think we constantly see both sides of this contradiction. The trade unions are part of the solution but are not the full solution. One of the ideas that Marx advocated for is imploring trade unions to connect with the unemployed in a single organization. Is that an option in places like the United States?

I think that it’s certainly the ideal — it’s what Marx and Engels were talking about in the Communist Manifesto in terms of the role of communists in the labor movement.

It also brings us back to the questions about the relationship between processes of exploitation and exclusion and about the relationship between struggles at the point of production and struggles in the street.

For trade unions seeking to follow Marx’s directive, it means thinking strategically about the conditions under which workers with stable waged employment can be drawn into and be radicalized by the struggles of the unemployed and precariously employed, and vice versa. What are the prospects for labor revitalization in the United States? Do you expect to see an upsurge in militancy and organization in the near future?

On the one hand, let me say that I do, just on theoretical grounds, expect an upsurge of labor militancy in the United States, and not just in the United States. On an empirical level, since 2008, we have been witnessing an upsurge worldwide in class-based social unrest, which may be seen in retrospect as the beginnings of a longer-term revitalization.

This assessment goes against the prevailing sentiment. It’s interesting to compare the current pessimism to what was being said by experts in the 1920s. At that time, they were looking at the ways in which craft workers were being undermined by the expansion of mass production, and they were claiming that the labor movement was mortally weakened and permanently dead. They were saying that right up until the eve of the mass wave of labor unrest in the mid 1930s.

They didn’t understand that, while it was true that a lot of the craft-worker unions were being undermined, there was a new working class in formation. We see the same thing today — a situation where there is a twentieth-century mass-production working class that’s being undermined, but there is also a new working class in formation, including in manufacturing.

It’s important not to just wipe manufacturing out of the consciousness of what’s happening even in the United States, much less in the world as a whole. Nevertheless, each time new waves of labor unrest erupt, the working class looks fundamentally different, and the strategies and mobilization again are fundamentally different. Who do you think would lead the upsurge this time around?

It’s hard to say. What is clearer are the critical issues facing labor today, and to some extent these point to the mass base and leadership needed for a “next upsurge” that is transformational. We’re in a situation where capital is destroying livelihoods at a much faster pace than it’s creating new ones, so we’re experiencing on a global scale, including in core countries and the United States, an expansion of the surplus population, and particularly what Marx referred to in Capital as the stagnant surplus population: those who are really never going to be incorporated into stable wage labor.

Contingent workers, temporary workers, part-time workers, and the long-term unemployed — this whole group is expanding, leading us down the road to pauperism. Notwithstanding the deep crisis of legitimacy this is creating for capitalism, there’s nothing, no tendency within capitalism itself, to go in a different direction. If we are going to change directions, it’s going to have to come from a mass political movement, rather than something coming out of capital itself.

There are two other important points to consider. One is that capitalist profitability, throughout its history, has depended on the partial externalization of not only the cost of reproduction of labor, but also the cost of reproduction of nature. This externalization is becoming increasingly untenable and unsustainable, but there’s also no inherent tendency within capital to redirect this.

Moreover, since the treatment of nature as a free good was a pillar of the postwar social compact tying mass production to the promise of working-class mass consumption, no simple return to the so-called golden age of Keynesianism and developmentalism is possible.

Second, the historical tendency in capitalism to resolve economic and political crises through expansionist, militaristic policies and war is something we have to take seriously, particularly in the current period of US hegemonic crisis and decline.

Getting control over oil, grabbing resources, fighting over sea lanes in the South China Sea — these struggles have the potential for incredibly horrific outcomes for humanity as a whole. To avoid this, a renewed and updated labor internationalism will have to overcome the visible tendencies toward a resurgent and atavistic labor nationalism.

So a consideration of geopolitics — examining the links between militarism, domestic conflict, and labor movements — is where we need to begin and end any serious analysis. The old question of socialism or barbarism is as relevant today as it has ever been.

Workers Vanguard No. 1096 23 September 2016

From the Archives of Marxism

“From the Kingdom of Necessity to the Kingdom of Freedom”

We publish below excerpts from Friedrich Engels’ 1880 work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. In explaining scientific socialism, Engels makes clear that only through the conquest of power by the working class and the expropriation of the capitalist class can the benefits of science, technology and education be available to all, laying the material basis for the full liberation of humanity. The excerpts below are taken from the Marx and Engels Selected Works (Progress Publishers, 1976).

The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men’s brains, not in men’s better insight into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange. They are to be sought not in the philosophy, but in the economics of each particular epoch. The growing perception that existing social institutions are unreasonable and unjust, that reason has become unreason and right wrong, is only proof that in the modes of production and exchange changes have silently taken place with which the social order, adapted to earlier economic conditions, is no longer in keeping. From this it also follows that the means of getting rid of the incongruities that have been brought to light must also be present, in a more or less developed condition, within the changed modes of production themselves. These means are not to be invented by deduction from fundamental principles, but are to be discovered in the stubborn facts of the existing system of production.

What is, then, the position of modern socialism in this connection?

The present structure of society—this is now pretty generally conceded—is the creation of the ruling class of today, of the bourgeoisie. The mode of production peculiar to the bourgeoisie, known, since Marx, as the capitalist mode of production, was incompatible with the feudal system, with the privileges it conferred upon individuals, entire social ranks and local corporations, as well as with the hereditary ties of subordination which constituted the framework of its social organisation. The bourgeoisie broke up the feudal system and built upon its ruins the capitalist order of society, the kingdom of free competition, of personal liberty, of the equality, before the law, of all commodity owners, of all the rest of the capitalist blessings. Thenceforward the capitalist mode of production could develop in freedom. Since steam, machinery, and the making of machines by machinery transformed the older manufacture into modern industry, the productive forces evolved under the guidance of the bourgeoisie developed with a rapidity and in degree unheard of before. But just as the older manufacture, in its time, and handicraft, becoming more developed under its influence, had come into collision with the feudal trammels of the guilds, so now modern industry, in its more complete development, comes into collision with the bounds within which the capitalistic mode of production holds it confined. The new productive forces have already outgrown the capitalistic mode of using them. And this conflict between productive forces and modes of production is not a conflict engendered in the mind of man, like that between original sin and divine justice. It exists, in fact, objectively, outside us, independently of the will and actions even of the men that have brought it on. Modern socialism is nothing but the reflex, in thought, of this conflict in fact; its ideal reflection in the minds, first, of the class directly suffering under it, the working class....

The perfecting of machinery is making human labour superfluous. If the introduction and increase of machinery means the displacement of millions of manual by a few machine-workers, improvement in machinery means the displacement of more and more of the machine-workers themselves. It means, in the last instance, the production of a number of available wage-workers in excess of the average needs of capital, the formation of a complete industrial reserve army, as I called it in 1845, available at the times when industry is working at high pressure, to be cast out upon the street when the inevitable crash comes, a constant dead weight upon the limbs of the working class in its struggle for existence with capital, a regulator for the keeping of wages down to the low level that suits the interests of capital. Thus it comes about, to quote Marx, that machinery becomes the most powerful weapon in the war of capital against the working class; that the instruments of labour constantly tear the means of subsistence out of the hands of the labourer; that the very product of the worker is turned into an instrument for his subjugation. Thus it comes about that the economising of the instruments of labour becomes at the same time, from the outset, the most reckless waste of labour power, and robbery based upon the normal conditions under which labour functions; that machinery, the most powerful instrument for shortening labour time, becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourer’s time and that of his family at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital. Thus it comes about that the overwork of some becomes the preliminary condition for the idleness of others, and that modern industry, which hunts after new consumers over the whole world, forces the consumption of the masses at home down to a starvation minimum, and in doing thus destroys its own home market. “The law that always equilibrates the relative surplus population, or industrial reserve army, to the extent and energy of accumulation, this law rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of Vulcan did Prometheus to the rock. It establishes an accumulation of misery, corresponding with accumulation of capital. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time, accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital.” (Marx’s Capital, p. 671)....

The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine, the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers—proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is rather brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution.

This solution can only consist in the practical recognition of the social nature of the modern forces of production, and therefore in the harmonising of the modes of production, appropriation, and exchange with the socialised character of the means of production. And this can only come about by society openly and directly taking possession of the productive forces which have outgrown all control except that of society as a whole. The social character of the means of production and of the products today reacts against the producers, periodically disrupts all production and exchange, acts only like a law of Nature working blindly, forcibly, destructively. But with the taking over by society of the productive forces, the social character of the means of production and of the products will be utilised by the producers with a perfect understanding of its nature, and instead of being a source of disturbance and periodical collapse, will become the most powerful lever of production itself....

Since the historical appearance of the capitalist mode of production, the appropriation by society of all the means of production has often been dreamed of, more or less vaguely, by individuals, as well as by sects, as the ideal of the future. But it could become possible, could become a historical necessity, only when the actual conditions for its realisation were there. Like every other social advance, it becomes practicable, not by men understanding that the existence of classes is in contradiction to justice, equality, etc., not by the mere willingness to abolish these classes, but by virtue of certain new economic conditions. The separation of society into an exploiting and an exploited class, a ruling and an oppressed class, was the necessary consequence of the deficient and restricted development of production in former times....

Division into classes has a certain historical justification, it has this only for a given period, only under given social conditions. It was based upon the insufficiency of production. It will be swept away by the complete development of modern productive forces. And, in fact, the abolition of classes in society presupposes a degree of historical evolution at which the existence, not simply of this or that particular ruling class, but of any ruling class at all, and, therefore, the existence of class distinction itself has become an obsolete anachronism. It presupposes, therefore, the development of production carried out to a degree at which appropriation of the means of production and of the products, and, with this, of political domination, of the monopoly of culture, and of intellectual leadership by a particular class of society, has become not only superfluous but economically, politically, intellectually, a hindrance to development.

This point is now reached. Their political and intellectual bankruptcy is scarcely any longer a secret to the bourgeoisie themselves. Their economic bankruptcy recurs regularly every ten years. In every crisis, society is suffocated beneath the weight of its own productive forces and products, which it cannot use, and stands helpless, face to face with the absurd contradiction that the producers have nothing to consume, because consumers are wanting. The expansive force of the means of production bursts the bonds that the capitalist mode of production had imposed upon them. Their deliverance from these bonds is the one precondition for an unbroken, constantly accelerated development of the productive forces, and therewith for a practically unlimited increase of production itself. Nor is this all. The socialised appropriation of the means of production does away, not only with the present artificial restrictions upon production, but also with the positive waste and devastation of productive forces and products that are at the present time the inevitable concomitants of production, and that reach their height in the crises. Further, it sets free for the community at large a mass of means of production and of products, by doing away with the senseless extravagance of the ruling classes of today and their political representatives. The possibility of securing for every member of society, by means of socialised production, an existence not only fully sufficient materially, and becoming day by day more full, but an existence guaranteeing to all the free development and exercise of their physical and mental faculties—this possibility is now for the first time here, but it is here.

With the seizing of the means of production by society, production of commodities is done away with, and, simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by systematic, definite organisation. The struggle for individual existence disappears. Then for the first time man, in a certain sense, is finally marked off from the rest of the animal kingdom, and emerges from mere animal conditions of existence into really human ones. The whole sphere of the conditions of life which environ man, and which have hitherto ruled man, now comes under the dominion and control of man, who for the first time becomes the real, conscious lord of Nature, because he has now become master of his own social organisation. The laws of his own social action, hitherto standing face to face with man as laws of Nature foreign to, and dominating him, will then be used with full understanding, and so mastered by him. Man’s own social organisation, hitherto confronting him as a necessity imposed by Nature and history, now becomes the result of his own free action. The extraneous objective forces that have hitherto governed history pass under the control of man himself. Only from that time will man himself, more and more consciously, make his own history—only from that time will the social causes set in movement by him have, in the main and in a constantly growing measure, the results intended by him. It is the ascent of man from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom....

To accomplish this act of universal emancipation is the historical mission of the modern proletariat. To thoroughly comprehend the historical conditions and thus the very nature of this act, to impart to the now oppressed proletarian class a full knowledge of the conditions and of the meaning of the momentous act it is called upon to accomplish, this is the task of the theoretical expression of the proletarian movement, scientific socialism.

Imperialist Hysteria After Nuclear Test

Defend North Korea!

On September 9, 2016, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test with an explosive yield of approximately 15 to 20 kilotons. Nuclear testing was initiated by North Korea in 2006. However, this was the second such test this year with a yield about twice the magnitude of any of the previous four documented detonations. During the past year North Korea has conducted several missile tests that have demonstrated its capacity to fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile as well as a solid-fuel, two-stage medium-range missile, covering northeast Asia, including Japan. Nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker pointed to the importance of these events: “At a minimum, the current state of the North’s nuclear arsenal is an effective deterrent to potential hostile external intervention” (38north.org, 12 September).

This achievement deserves the acclaim of the world’s working and oppressed masses. It enhances the defense of the social revolution that survived U.S. imperialism’s efforts to drown it in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War. General Douglas MacArthur and others in U.S. ruling circles were intent on using the peninsula as a launching pad from which to overturn the 1949 Chinese Revolution. Simultaneously, North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and effective delivery systems serves to impede the U.S.’s current campaign—coyly dubbed the “Pivot to Asia”—to encircle and eventually throttle the People’s Republic of China, by far the most powerful of the deformed workers states that have survived in the aftermath of the 1991-92 counterrevolution in the Soviet Union. It is vital for the international proletariat to stand for the unconditional military defense of the North Korean and Chinese deformed workers states.

The U.S. has repeatedly denounced North Korea’s nuclear tests. Provocatively, in the aftermath of the September 9 detonation, two U.S. bombers, accompanied by Japanese and South Korean fighter jets, flew at low altitude only 48 miles from the North Korean border. Admiral Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, described this operation as a response to “North Korea’s provocative and destabilizing actions.” Adopting the role of stooge for the U.S. imperialists, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon—a one-time South Korean deputy ambassador to the U.S.—fulminated over the North’s “provocative actions.” He demanded additional UN sanctions against the Kim Jong Un regime, on top of the harsh measures adopted in March after the first of this year’s nuclear tests. Meanwhile, a South Korean military source threatened to reduce North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, to ashes should the North show any signs of using its nuclear arms. The backbone for this bellicosity is provided by the more than 28,000 American troops currently stationed in South Korea.

It is the U.S. that, from the time of the Korean War, has been responsible for an unending series of provocations and savageries. During that war, carried out under the auspices of the UN, the U.S. utilized oceans of napalm to incinerate the population, with a resultant slaughter of over three million Koreans. It was due to the heroic struggle of Korea’s workers and peasants and the intervention of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army that the imperialists did not succeed in overturning the social revolution in the North. The war ended in an armistice, sealing Korea’s division along class lines at the 38th parallel. Subsequently, Washington went on to prop up a number of dictatorial regimes in the South that ruled through sheer terror, while the U.S. forces permanently stationed there were often used to quell popular unrest and to suppress labor actions.

Since the fall of the USSR, China’s reward for its longstanding cooperation with the U.S. to isolate and weaken the Soviet Union has been to increasingly find itself placed in the crosshairs of the American imperialists. The U.S. has usually avoided using the direct threat of military action against China, often invoking the specter of attacks launched by North Korea to justify its military operations in the region. Thus, it was North Korea, not China, that was dubbed part of the “axis of evil.” In spite of China’s ardent wooing of the reactionary Park Geun-hye regime in the South, her government has agreed to the installation of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) missile shield by the U.S. as a defense against the North. This has exercised China, which rightly perceives the system to be a threat to its missiles. In 2009 Thaad was installed in Hawaii supposedly to prevent a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile attack. At that time the North had no such capacity, but China did. Our demand for all U.S. forces and bases out of South Korea is both a defense of North Korea and the Chinese Revolution.

Both the Republican and Democratic candidates for the presidency are running primarily on their purported virtues as the leader most qualified to smash America’s enemies abroad. Although ISIS is the main target of their fulminations, the ultimate target for U.S. imperialism is the Chinese deformed workers state. In the past four years, the number of soldiers and civilian army workers in Asia has increased from 70,000 to more than 100,000. In response to China’s just and legitimate claim to the Spratly Islands, the U.S. has been conducting aggressive naval operations in the South China Sea, which the Japanese navy will soon join. The U.S. is also seeking to bolster joint military training exercises with Australia to address “challenges” in the region.

When North Korea conducted a nuclear test in January, the Chinese Stalinist regime criminally assisted the U.S., even helping to draft the sanctions that the UN imposed in March. Since then, the U.S. has been frustrated by Chinese unwillingness to implement the sanctions, as it now seeks more sanctions, as yet unspecified. Absent China’s implementation, the sanctions have had little impact, as 90 percent of North Korea’s trade is with China. Today, China views North Korea’s nuclear tests as a buffer against the hostile intents of the U.S. But as demonstrated by its support for the March sanctions, this appreciation could change in a second. At this time, China is unwilling to entertain the collapse of the North Korean regime, which would plunge the peninsula into chaos. It has also been planning to deepen military cooperation with Russia (the other major obstacle to U.S. imperialism’s overwhelming military dominance), including a joint naval drill to be hosted by China later this year.

It is unfortunately true that North Korea’s success in developing its nuclear capability is in no way sufficient to the task of defending the social revolution that was solidified in the context of the Korean War. North Korea and China as well as Cuba, Vietnam and Laos are deformed workers states: societies based on the expropriation of their respective capitalist class rulers and where that rule was replaced by working-class property forms—i.e., the nationalization of production and a state monopoly on all foreign trade. At the same time, these countries are governed by parasitic bureaucratic castes whose rule is based on the political expropriation of the working class.

Our defense of the deformed workers states does not entail political support for the ruling bureaucracies, which in North Korea is deeply nationalist, weirdly nepotistic and brutally repressive. Committed to “socialism” only in its half of the Korean Peninsula, the Kim regime disdains the struggle for socialist revolution in the South and calls for “peaceful reunification” of Korea, a setup for capitalist reunification.

We fight for workers political revolution in the deformed workers states in order to sweep away bureaucratic misrule and open the road to the further expansion of proletarian revolution. The parasitic bureaucracies understand that their privileges would not survive proletarian political revolutions, and thus to secure their well-being, they offer their services to the imperialists as they pursue the chimera of “peaceful coexistence” with the world capitalist order. The imperialists, for their part, are willing to deal in the short run while never abandoning their hostility to the survival of proletarian power anywhere on the planet.

For its part, the various manifestations of the Kim dynasty in North Korea have episodically displayed a willingness to abandon their efforts to obtain deterrent capacity in exchange for economic assistance from the American imperialists. Although North Korea has recovered somewhat from the economic disaster that befell it in the aftermath of the destruction of the Soviet Union, its economy remains precarious and will certainly suffer from the extensive damage it sustained late last month as a result of Typhoon Lionrock. It now plans to launch international appeals for donations, causing many bourgeois pundits to indicate that such assistance will not be forthcoming given their bad behavior, i.e., daring to conduct a nuclear test.

We fight for the revolutionary reunification of Korea: proletarian socialist revolution in the South in conjunction with working-class political revolution in the North. A struggle for the revolutionary reunification of Korea would ignite other struggles for proletarian power throughout the region. Today the South Korean economy is in the tank, with unprecedented levels of youth unemployment, and there is evident popular resentment against the planned introduction by the U.S. of the Thaad missile shield. The objective conditions to ignite the struggle for a revolutionary reunification have long existed.

Defense of North Korea, China and the other remaining deformed workers states is integral to the fight for socialist revolution in the advanced capitalist countries, including Japan, the imperialist powerhouse of Asia, and the U.S., the planet’s most dominant power. The International Communist League is dedicated to forging the proletarian vanguard parties that, as sections of a reforged Fourth International, can lead the working class in sweeping away the capitalist-imperialist order and building a world socialist society of material abundance.

Workers Vanguard No. 1094 26 August 2016

Capitalist Green Party No Alternative

We Need a Revolutionary Workers Party!

Coming off the Democratic National Convention—where retired four-star Marine general John Allen roused the party faithful into jingoistic chants of “USA! USA!”—Hillary Clinton has been racking up endorsements from a veritable rogues’ gallery of U.S. imperialism’s leading warmongers, mass murderers and Dr. Strangeloves. In early August, 50 former top national security advisors to Republican administrations going back to Richard Nixon signed a letter declaring that their party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, “would be the most reckless President in American history.” What moved them to jump ship was not Trump’s flagrant racism, a card the GOP has been playing for decades, albeit somewhat more sotto voce.

Rather, these Republicans lost it when Trump opined that he would not necessarily support the Baltic NATO states if Russia attacked. For more than a decade, the U.S. imperialists have been provoking capitalist Russia, including through a military buildup of NATO forces on its borders. Now the Democrats and many Republicans are seizing on Trump’s stated affinity for Vladimir Putin to portray him as a Manchurian candidate, a puppet for the Russian president. In a 5 August New York Times op-ed piece titled “I Ran the C.I.A. Now I’m Endorsing Hillary Clinton,” Michael Morell, former acting director of the CIA, put it baldly: “In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.”

In contrast, Morell promotes Clinton’s qualifications to be Commander-in-Chief of U.S. imperialism. He points to her role as an “early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice” (i.e., murdered him and threw his body into the sea) and a consistent promoter of a “more aggressive approach” in Syria (i.e., bomb ’em back to the Stone Age). He salutes her willingness to “use force” and “her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all—whether to put young American women and men in harm’s way.” No wonder that she has for months been getting the support of several leading neocons who worry that Trump is an “unreliable” loose cannon. In short, Clinton is a proven, gold-plated war hawk.

Donald Trump is a dangerous demagogue, capable of saying and doing just about anything. And there is plenty for working people and the oppressed to fear as he incites a frenzy of “America First” chauvinist reaction among his supporters, who include the race-terrorists of the KKK and other fascists. It is this fear that the Democrats have cynically played on to get black people, immigrants, workers and the now-dejected youthful followers of Bernie Sanders to rally behind Clinton.

In the Democratic primaries, 77 percent of the black vote went to Clinton. Overwhelmingly, black people see the former party of the Confederacy and the Jim Crow South as the only option to defeat Trump. It was heartbreaking to see the mothers of Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and others killed at the hands of the cops or racist vigilantes on stage at the Democratic Convention for the coronation of a woman who reviled young black men as “superpredators” and backed her husband’s racist anti-crime bill and the destruction of welfare.

As always the labor misleaders offered their services, with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka also taking the stage to push the whopping lie that Clinton will “protect workplace rights” and “stand up to Wall Street.” The union tops’ allegiance to the Democrats is an old shell game. Their subordination of the interests of the working class to the party of their exploiters has left a trail of broken strikes, busted unions and the ongoing destruction of the livelihood of working people.

Meanwhile, as she tries to court Republicans, Clinton’s attentions are directed not to the traditional base of the Democrats but to wooing Wall Street and the generals, spies and other operatives of U.S. imperialism into her “big tent.” And she has been very successful. As Black Agenda Report editor Glen Ford wrote in “Hillary Stuffs Entire U.S. Ruling Class into Her Big, Nasty Tent” (10 August):

“It’s a funky place to be—especially for the traditional Black, brown and labor ‘base’ of the party, now squished into a remote and malodorous corner of the tent, near the latrine, clutching the pages of a party platform that was never meant to bind anyone....

“She is the candidate of the imperial war machine, whose operatives have flocked to her corner in dread of Trump’s willingness to make ‘deals’ with the Russians and Chinese. She is the candidate of multinational corporations, which are perfectly confident she is lying about her stance on TPP and other trade deals. And she is the candidate of the CIA and its fellow global outlaws, who will thrive as never before with a president in the White House who cackles ‘We came, we saw, he died’ when the leader of an African country is murdered by Islamic jihadists supported by the United States.”

If elected, Clinton will have her trigger-happy fingers on the nuclear button. For his part, Ford, like other radical liberals, not to mention a cast of self-proclaimed socialists, looks for refuge in the capitalist Green Party.

From Bernie Sanders to the Greens

Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin succinctly explained that the fraud of bourgeois democracy amounts to deciding “once every few years which member of the ruling class is to repress and crush the people.” In this contest between perhaps the two most despised candidates in U.S. history, we aim to drive home the Marxist understanding of the class nature of the capitalist order, and the need to build a multiracial revolutionary workers party independent of and in opposition to the rule of the capitalist class enemy and all its parties.

In contrast, organizations like Socialist Alternative (SAlt) and the International Socialist Organization (ISO), notwithstanding their rare genuflections to Marxism, are busy trying to pump some air into the deflated tire of bourgeois electoralism by channeling discontent into support for the Green Party’s presidential candidate, Jill Stein. Having spent the last year rallying behind Bernie Sanders and his calls for a “political revolution against the billionaire class,” SAlt wailed that Sanders “walked out on that strategy, and called for a vote for the very establishment we have been fighting against.” In fact, he did exactly what he promised when he launched his campaign: to back the winner of the Democratic primaries. As we wrote in “Break with the Capitalist Democrats and Republicans!” (WV No. 1092, 1 July):

“Many of those who support Sanders believe that his primary bid has launched a ‘movement’ that represents some kind of challenge to the political establishment. In fact, Sanders has done everything to reinforce this establishment by refurbishing its image and reinforcing illusions and confidence in American capitalist democracy. He brought large numbers of disaffected young people ‘into the political process’ (read: Democratic Party)....

“To put it plainly: the pseudo-socialist groups that support Sanders have done their best, within the limits of their forces, to reinforce the ties that bind the working class politically to its class enemies. As revolutionary Marxists, we offer no political support on principle to any party of the bosses—not only the major parties of the U.S. ruling class, the Republicans and Democrats, but also small-time capitalist parties such as the Greens.”

Having led many youth and others down the garden path with Sanders, SAlt is now trying to corral them behind Stein’s campaign as “the clear continuation of our political revolution.” Kshama Sawant, SAlt’s Seattle city council member, argues that Stein “has gone further than Bernie, in particular with her rejection of key aspects of U.S. foreign policy.” That wouldn’t be hard. Sanders argues that the U.S. “should have the strongest military in the world” and has an impeccable record of support to the wars, occupations, drone strikes and other depredations of U.S. imperialism (see “Bernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog,” WV No. 1083, 12 February).

And what is the position of Stein’s Green Party? Her election platform calls for cutting in half the U.S. military budget, which is many times more than the combined total of all its imperialist rivals. So Stein is for fewer bombs than Bernie and Hillary but is nonetheless dedicated to preserving an arsenal to enforce the predatory and murderous interests of America’s rulers abroad.

Stein’s program calls to “restore the National Guard as the centerpiece of our defense.” You know, the National Guard that occupied Ferguson to put down protests against the cop killing of Michael Brown in 2014; the National Guard that union-busting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker had on standby to do the same against black protests in Milwaukee; the National Guard that shot dead four antiwar protesters at Kent State in 1970 after being called in from a nearby deployment against a Teamsters strike; the National Guard that, as the domestic troops enforcing the diktats of America’s capitalist rulers, has the blood of countless striking workers on its hands.

For its part, the ISO has also, and yet again, thrown its support to the Green Party. In particular, the ISO is enthused over “the passage of an amendment to the party platform making the Greens an explicitly anti-capitalist party.” Why would that make any difference to the ISO? They supported the Green Party and even ran their own members as candidates of the party when the Greens openly described themselves as a party of “small business, responsible stakeholder capitalism.” Despite the Green Party’s current proclaimed rejection of the “capitalist system,” the amendment to its program doesn’t change its character as a bourgeois party and is, in fact, “balanced” by also rejecting “state socialism,” raising the all-purpose anti-communist bogeyman of totalitarianism.

The Greens’ vision is of “an economy based on large-scale green public works, municipalization, and workplace and community democracy.” Such a Shangri-La is a pipe dream conjured up by relatively well-heeled and overwhelmingly white middle-class people who live in advanced capitalist countries and have their homes in neighborhoods far removed from the industry required for a modern economy. They are the types that have access to resources for “local sustainability,” with vegetable plots, bike paths and a city council that will raise taxes on such unhealthy habits as smoking and sugary sodas, depriving the poor and working class of some of the few pleasures they have in life.

Stein also says she stands for beneficial things like free Medicare for all, a living wage, jobs for the unemployed, free education through university, etc. But these promises—which in themselves would only provide limited relief from the all-sided destitution faced by working people and the poor—are hot air. Such concessions will only be wrung from the bourgeoisie through class struggle, mobilizing the social power of the working class whose labor produces the wealth that is stolen by the capitalist exploiters.

For working people to get their hands on that wealth, the capitalists’ power has to be broken. That means a workers party that fights for a workers government to expropriate the capitalist owners and expand the productive forces in order to create an egalitarian socialist society, one devoted to providing for the needs of the many, not the profits of the few. This is counterposed to the program of the Green Party, which is devoted not to increasing but to decreasing production and consumption—purportedly to “save the earth,” not its human inhabitants.

The Third Party Fraud

There have been several third-party candidacies in the history of the U.S. From Robert La Follette’s 1924 presidential bid to Henry Wallace’s 1948 Progressive Party, their purpose has been to corral discontent with the two major parties into another capitalist electoral vehicle with promises of a better deal for the “little guy.” In its call to “Fix Our Broken System,” the Green Party promotes the value of third parties to not only “lure voters to the polls” but “also help to turn one of the major parties out of office.” As an example, they point to Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party, whose 1912 election campaign “helped the Democrats wrest the White House from 20 years of unchallenged Republican supremacy.” The winner was Southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson, an arch-segregationist who drove blacks out of federal civil service jobs and was an admirer of the Ku Klux Klan.

Similarly, the Green Party’s statement argues that third parties keep “Americans involved in our democratic process” by providing “an ‘emotional bridge’ for voters who are weary of supporting one major party but are not yet ready to vote for the other.” Here they grotesquely hold up the 1968 presidential campaign of George Wallace. “Segregation forever” Wallace was the former Dixiecrat governor of Alabama who revolted against civil rights legislation. According to the Greens, his American Independent Party campaign “drew support from traditional Southern Democrats who weren’t emotionally prepared to vote as Republicans.” The Southern Democrats crossed that “emotional bridge” and are now a major component of the racist yahoos rallying for Trump.

And it’s not just them. Last summer, former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader heralded Trump as a “breath of fresh air.” Welcoming Trump’s then-refusal to rule out a third party challenge if he lost the GOP nomination, Nader argued: “The two party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it.” Wow—the ticket to breaking the domination of big business is a billionaire real estate mogul!

To all those who bought Sanders’ phony “political revolution,” don’t get fooled again by Stein’s Green Party. The facade of bourgeois democracy is designed to obscure the fact that the capitalist state is an instrument of organized force and violence, consisting at its core of the police, army, courts and prisons. Its purpose is to maintain capitalist rule and profit through the suppression of the working class, the forcible segregation of the majority of black people at the bottom of society and by advancing the interests of U.S. imperialism abroad.

It is a myth that working people and the oppressed can elect a reformed capitalist government that will defend their interests against the robber barons of Wall Street. As communists, we champion the fight for jobs for all at good wages; for decent housing; for quality, fully government-funded health care and education. Our purpose is to link such demands to building a revolutionary working-class party that will inscribe on its banner the defense of immigrant rights and the fight for black freedom as part of the struggle to overthrow this decaying capitalist system. As the Spartacist League/U.S. Declaration of Principles, written at our founding 50 years ago, states:

“The victory of the proletariat on a world scale would place unimagined material abundance at the service of human needs, lay the basis for the elimination of social classes, and eliminate forever the drive for war inherent in the world economic system of capitalism. For the first time mankind will grasp the reins of history and control its own creation, society, resulting in an undreamed-of emancipation of human potential, the limitless expansion of freedom in every area, and a monumental forward surge of civilization. Only then will it be possible to realize the free development of each individual as the condition for the free development of all.”

Workers Vanguard No. 109 29 July 2016

Remembering Hiroshima, Nagasaki

U.S. Imperialist Mass Murder

Seventy-one years ago this August, some 200,000 residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were incinerated when U.S. warplanes dropped atomic bombs in the closing weeks of World War II. Many thousands who survived the nuclear holocaust suffered hideous burns and deformities compounded by sheer terror. This monstrous crime—carried out in the name of fighting for “democracy”—epitomizes the savagery of the capitalist-imperialist world order. Hearing the news of the 6 August 1945 attack on Hiroshima, which was followed by the destruction of Nagasaki three days later, U.S. president Harry Truman exulted: “This is the greatest thing in history!” and gloated that “we are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely.” The visit of Barack Obama to Hiroshima in May of this year was the first by a sitting U.S. president.

Our forebears of the then-revolutionary Socialist Workers Party (SWP) immediately condemned the bombings as part of their opposition to the U.S. and all capitalist powers in the interimperialist war. This position was coupled with the SWP’s unconditional military defense of the Soviet Union, a degenerated workers state. While the Stalinist U.S. Communist Party grotesquely hailed the A-bomb attacks as part of its craven support to the “democratic” imperialists, SWP leader James P. Cannon, who had been hauled off to prison along with 17 other party leaders and Minneapolis Teamsters officials for their principled opposition to the war, declared in a speech in New York City:

“What a commentary on the real nature of capitalism in its decadent phase is this, that the scientific conquest of the marvelous secret of atomic energy, which might rationally be used to lighten the burdens of all mankind, is employed first for the wholesale destruction of half a million people.”

—“The Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” 22 August 1945, printed in The Struggle for Socialism in the “American Century” (Pathfinder Press, 1977)

Cannon ended the talk with a call to build a Leninist workers party that would fight to “answer the imperialist program of war on the peoples of the world, with revolution at home and peace with the peoples of the world.”

The A-bombs created a special kind of hell. But so did the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo a few months before, which took at least 100,000 lives. For its part, Japanese imperialism had demonstrated its own barbarity by the 1937 Nanjing Massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese by Japanese troops. In Europe, the Nazi regime carried out industrial genocide against Jews, gays, Gypsies and others. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Britain slaughtered hundreds of thousands of German working people by firebombing Dresden, Hamburg and other cities.

U.S. atrocities against the Japanese population were prepared with the kind of virulently racist propaganda that the Nazis used to ostracize Jews and other so-called untermenschen on their way to annihilating them, and which the Japanese rulers spewed against Chinese, Koreans and others they subjugated. The U.S. capitalist press continually depicted the Japanese as “sneak attackers,” hurling venom against “yellow monkeys” or, in the snootier words of the New York Times, against “a beast which sometimes stands erect.” This poison delivered the message: anything could be done to this enemy. And it was long lasting. In 1995, the Smithsonian Institution canceled a planned exhibition on Hiroshima featuring the Enola Gay—the B-29 that dropped the first A-bomb—after a furious reaction from jingoists and militarists objecting to photographs showing the horrors suffered by Japanese civilians.

Official duplicity was the order of the day when on May 27 Barack Obama visited Hiroshima’s memorial to the victims of the A-bomb. Obama had made clear that he would not bother with an apology for the slaughter carried out by his Democratic Party predecessor, which would have been an empty gesture in any case. Instead, he displayed the lying, hypocritical cant that has been a hallmark of his time in office. Obama haughtily declared that countries like the U.S. with nuclear stockpiles “must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them.” Just a few months earlier, he had rolled out a plan to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next three decades, to the tune of $1 trillion!

Obama’s Hiroshima visit was part of a big lie. His amen corner in the U.S. media regurgitated the line that the A-bombs were what forced Japan’s surrender in the war. In fact, Japan was already on the verge of defeat when Truman learned of the successful atomic bomb test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. At the time, he was in Potsdam, Germany, for talks with Britain’s Winston Churchill and Soviet leader J. V. Stalin over the postwar division of Europe following Germany’s military defeat. The Red Army had smashed Hitler’s forces, at the cost of 27 million Soviet lives. With Soviet troops occupying half of Europe and poised to enter the war against Japan, the A-bombs were above all a message to Moscow of the lengths to which the American rulers would go to assert world domination.

Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of Allied forces in West Europe during the war and later U.S. president, noted in a 1963 interview that the Japanese were ready to surrender and “it wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing.” Washington knew from decoded cables that many in the Japanese government were looking for a peace settlement, but the U.S. insisted on unconditional surrender, thereby ensuring that Japan would not give in until the bombs were dropped. As we emphasized in “Behind U.S. Imperialism’s Nuclear Holocaust” (WV No. 628, 8 September 1995), “The A-bombing of Japan was in fact the first act of the emerging Cold War aimed at destroying the Soviet degenerated workers state.”

Washington’s purpose was further made clear by its ongoing attempt, soon to be successful, to develop a thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb to gain another leg up on the Soviets, who the U.S. feared were about to build their own A-bomb. Moscow countered by developing a substantial nuclear arsenal, reaching rough parity with the U.S. in the 1970s. For decades, the Soviet arsenal helped stay the hand of U.S. imperialism. But following the capitalist counterrevolution that destroyed the USSR in 1991-92, the arrogant American rulers saw no obstacle to world domination, setting the stage for a series of wars and occupations from the Balkans to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Excluding the Soviet Union, World War II, like WWI, was fought between imperialist powers for resources, markets and spheres of exploitation. China was the special prize of the Pacific War. But the U.S. was denied that part of the spoils of its victory over Japan by the 1949 Chinese Revolution, which created a workers state that, despite bureaucratic deformation, remains the chief target of imperialist designs in Asia. Indeed, the main purpose of Obama’s trip to Southeast and East Asia in May was to firm up U.S. allies and quislings as they tighten a military ring around China.

In Hiroshima, Obama pitched the strategic U.S.-Japanese alliance, which centrally targets China and also the North Korean deformed workers state. Another piece of Washington’s Asian fortress fell into place in July when the South Korean government agreed to host the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system. Ostensibly a response to North Korea’s testing of new ballistic missiles, Thaad’s radar array can cover a broad swath of China, potentially degrading China’s land-based nuclear deterrent.

U.S. and Japanese workers must stand with China and North Korea in their efforts to develop nuclear weapons and delivery systems that provide a measure of defense against imperialist blackmail and attack. Defense of the remaining deformed workers states is inseparable from the struggle to sweep away the capitalist system, with its insatiable thirst for profit and its inherent drive toward war. In opposing the U.S.-Japanese imperialist alliance, we join with our comrades of the Spartacist Group Japan, who wrote in marking the 50th anniversary of the atomic bomb attacks: “Nanjing, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chilling examples of the slaughter and devastation that will be repeated in a coming war if the imperialist bourgeoisie is not overthrown by proletarian socialist revolution” (“Hiroshima, Nagasaki: U.S. War Crimes,” WV No. 627, 25 August 1995).

"Postal Labor Union, Activists push for the U.S. Postal Service to offer basic banking",Liberal,3,4w0nun,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4w0nun/postal_labor_union_activists_push_for_the_us/,0,"Until the late 1960s, you could walk into a post office and deposit money in a savings account at the same time that you bought stamps or mailed packages.

An outgrowth of the financial panic of 1907, the no-frills postal bank surged in popularity during the Great Depression. But as commercial banks expanded and offered higher interest rates, the United States Postal Savings System became as outdated as a black-and-white movie.

Now, in the wake of another financial crisis, there's a new push for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver basic banking services again.

The effort is led by consumer advocates, financial reform groups, postal labor unions and some leading liberals, such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). They say that offering services such as paycheck cashing, bill payment and free ATMs would provide cash-strapped consumers with an affordable alternative to payday, auto-title and other short-term loans that have been criticized for high fees.

""We have millions and millions of low-income people who have to go to these payday lenders and pay outrageous interest rates. They're getting ripped off right and left,"" Sanders said on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" in October.

""We can have our Postal Service provide modest banking to low-income people where they can cash their checks and they can do banking,"" Sanders said. ""I think it will help the post office and it will help millions of low-income people.""

The Postal Service's inspector general's office agrees. It estimates that expanding financial services beyond the current limited offerings, which include money orders and international funds transfers, could pump $8.9 billion a year into the financially struggling agency.

""The Postal Service has a public mission to serve citizens and support the growth of commerce,"" the inspector general's office said in a report last spring that presented five potential approaches for expanded banking services. ""And while it is required to cover its costs, profit is not its key motive.""

The American Postal Workers Union has formed a coalition, the Campaign for Postal Banking, that in December delivered a petition with more than 150,000 signatures to Deputy Postmaster General Ronald A. Stroman urging the agency to expand its financial offerings.

""Big banks are turning their backs on families,"" union President Mark Dimondstein said. ""Without bank accounts, they fall prey to predatory lenders.""

Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan hasn't ruled out the idea of expanded banking services after her predecessor dismissed the suggestion in January as he headed into retirement. But she has some reservations.

""While we currently provide our customers with certain financial services, including money orders, electronic funds transfers and cashing of U.S. Treasury checks, our core function is not banking,"" the agency said in a written statement. Get our weekly business news briefing >>

The service said it has an ""infrastructure that is not ideal as a banking platform,"" and cited a decline in visits to post offices. Plus, any investments outside of its core function of mail delivery ""will likely be scrutinized from both public policy and regulatory perspectives,"" the agency added.

The Postal Service is an independent agency that since 1971 has been required to rely on sales of stamps and other services to pay for its operations. But the growth of the Internet and competition from private shippers, such as FedEx Corp. and UPS, have taken a major toll on the agency's finances.

After peaking in 2006, total mail handled by the Postal Service has declined 27%. That has led to budget deficits, exacerbated by a congressional requirement to pre-fund retirement benefits for its workers, that have forced the agency to borrow up to its allowable limit of $15 billion from the U.S. Treasury.

Expanded financial services offer ""the single best opportunity for new revenue,"" according to the inspector general's office.

It's not a far-fetched idea. Post offices in many other nations, including Britain, France, China and Japan, also serve as banks. And from 1911 to 1967, the United States Postal Savings System offered accounts with annual interest capped at 2%, to reduce competition with commercial banks.

Deposits at U.S. postal banks surged during the Great Depression and World War II, when many consumers viewed the accounts as more secure than those in commercial banks. But as those banks opened more branches and increased interest rates after the war, the postal banking system fell out of favor and the federal government shut it down.

The Great Recession has led to calls for the revival of postal banks as many cash-strapped households have been forced to seek payday loans and other alternative financial products.

A Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey found that about 9.6 million households in 2013 had no one with a bank account. An additional 24.8 million households had accounts but also used alternative financial services, such as payday loans.

""It's harder for people with less money to use their money, and much more expensive,"" said Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of Georgia professor and author of the book ""How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation and the Threat to Democracy.""

Many poor areas lack bank branches, but most communities have a post office, said Katherine Isaac, a consultant to the postal workers union who has been organizing the Campaign for Postal Banking.

""Even if we put all the payday lenders out of business, there's a concern that there's still no place to go,"" Isaac said. ""The banks aren't there. They've abandoned those communities. But the post office is there.""

The Postal Service is the most popular federal agency — 84% of respondents have a positive view of it, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll.

""I would guess that a lot of people would trust the post office teller with their money more than these Wall Street traders,"" said Baradaran, an advocate for postal banks. ""There's a sense that the post office is a dinosaur, but it's not a shark.""

Congress would have to pass legislation allowing post offices to take deposits and make loans. But the Postal Service could use existing authority to increase some offerings, such as expanding check cashing to include other government and payroll checks and broadening money orders into bill payment service, supporters said.

""This is not a cash cow for the post office,"" Baradaran said. ""But it could save them.""

WikiLeaks reveals DNC holds labor unions in contempt (x-post /r/Leftwinger),Liberal,2,4vski5,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4vski5/wikileaks_reveals_dnc_holds_labor_unions_in/,0,"The latest WikiLeaks document dump — containing emails by high-ranking staffers of the Democratic National Committee — caused considerable heartburn for America’s oldest political party. But what’s just as interesting is the dog that didn’t bark — the fact that wasn’t regarded as a scandal but perhaps ought to have been.

Even casual political observers can see that labor union leadership and the Democratic Party are allied. AFL-CIO boss Richard Trumka spoke at the convention the other night, endorsing Hillary Clinton and calling the Republican nominee “wrong, wrong, wrong” for America.

Yet the emails that have been released highlight the rather one-way relationship between the Democratic Party and labor unions. DNC staffers see the unions as good soldiers in skirmishes with Republicans, as a pain when it comes to getting things done and, ultimately, as pushovers.

When brainstorming what to do about last week’s Republican National Convention, the DNC’s Rachel Palermo urged her party to “meet with the hotel trades, SEIU, and Fight for 15 about staging a strike.” She said the result could be a “fast food worker strike around the city or just at franchises around the convention.” The aim would not be to improve working conditions, but to bloody Republicans.

Alternately, the DNC could “infiltrate friendly union hotels and properties around the convention that Republicans will be patronizing to distribute ‘care’ packages” — probably not chocolates.

Palermo also noted that “SEIU has space in downtown Cleveland close to convention that can be the base of operations and host the wrapped mobile RV.”

The union-DNC alliance does impose a few constraints on the DNC, which staffers both mocked and worked to circumvent. DNC staffer Katja Greeson, for instance, complained about delays involved in getting new business cards printed.

She explained to an irked communications director that sending work to union shops caused delays. “Believe me — it is equally frustrating to us,” she said. Greeson also threatened “if they can’t deliver,” DNC staffers would “go to FedEx Kinkos” and do it themselves.

The DNC pledges to use only unionized hotels. But it turns out there’s a workaround for that, too. Trey Kovacs, who has done yeoman’s work spelunking through the DNC WikiLeaks dump, uncovered this one. In an exchange over whether they could use the non-union Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., a DNC staffer says they could just get a “waiver” to use it.

“It is unclear from the emails how or what circumstances must arise to obtain a waiver, but it seems that convenience for the chairman trumps loyalty to adhering to some kind of internal guidelines of exclusively patronizing unionized establishments,” Kovacs, a policy analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told me Wednesday.

Because this document dump has emails both to and from the DNC, we also hear from the unions themselves, which might explain why the party can count on their support come-what-may.

For instance, Sandra Lyon of the American Federation of Teachers asked for any “regular talking points” the DNC might have to pass on to AFT folks who speak with the media.

And the National Education Organization’s political communications director Michael Misterek wrote longingly to the DNC in May, “I’m hoping we can sit down to meet some time soon, over coffee or a cocktail. I’d love to figure out how we can work together and be most helpful to each other these next few months.”

Fake 'Socialists' Pimp for Imperialist Sanders,Liberal,0,4u47cp,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4u47cp/fake_socialists_pimp_for_imperialist_sanders/,0,"The two main capitalist parties have effectively chosen their presumptive nominees for chief executive of U.S. imperialism. For the Republicans, it’s the bigoted, wealthy real estate mogul and reality TV star, now turned populist demagogue, Donald Trump. Obama’s former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, the quintessential Democratic Party machine politician and imperialist warmonger, is the standard-bearer for the other party of war and racism.

A primary challenge to Clinton by “democratic socialist” Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was embraced not only by many liberals but also by various self-proclaimed socialist groups. These reformists have bought and sold the claims by Sanders—who for a quarter century has caucused with the Democrats in Congress—that he stands for a “political revolution against the billionaire class.” His bid for the nomination having ended in failure, Sanders is now bargaining for concessions from the Clinton Democrats, including in the meaningless party platform.

Sanders attracted support from college and other petty-bourgeois youth, as well as a layer of workers, by inveighing against Wall Street and promoting reforms, such as free college tuition, Medicare for all, reducing student debt and a $15 an hour minimum wage. At the same time, he is a stalwart champion of bloody U.S. imperialism—from his support to the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force that launched the war on Afghanistan to his Senate vote endorsing the Israeli massacre of Palestinians in Gaza in 2014 (see “Bernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog,” WV No. 1083, 12 February). Like Trump, Sanders also pushes chauvinist protectionism, which serves to set workers in the U.S. against their class brothers and sisters abroad.

Many of those who support Sanders believe that his primary bid has launched a “movement” that represents some kind of challenge to the political establishment. In fact, Sanders has done everything to reinforce this establishment by refurbishing its image and reinforcing illusions and confidence in American capitalist democracy. He brought large numbers of disaffected young people “into the political process” (read: Democratic Party), for which he received a standing ovation from Senate Democrats on June 14. As Jeffrey St. Clair wrote in CounterPunch (10 June): “In fact, the Democrats were surely gratified to see Sanders out there, drawing attention to a dull and lifeless party that would otherwise have been totally eclipsed by the Trump media blitzkrieg. Sanders served the valuable function of energizing and registering on the Democratic Party rolls tens of thousands of new voters.”

To put it plainly: the pseudo-socialist groups that support Sanders have done their best, within the limits of their forces, to reinforce the ties that bind the working class politically to its class enemies. As revolutionary Marxists, we offer no political support on principle to any party of the bosses—not only the major parties of the U.S. ruling class, the Republicans and Democrats, but also small-time capitalist parties such as the Greens.

We fight to build a multiracial, revolutionary workers party, the necessary instrument to fight against the depredations of the capitalist system, including poverty, unemployment and racial oppression, as part of the struggle for socialist revolution. The irreconcilable conflict between the collective producers of social wealth and the capitalist class that exploits their labor is inherent in the capitalist system. While there has been little class struggle in this country for decades, workers’ potential power can be glimpsed in recent outbreaks such as the Verizon strike (see article, page 3)—as well as internationally with the victorious steel workers strike in Mexico or the upsurge of class battles in France. The key lies in making the working class conscious of its historic role as the gravedigger of the capitalist system, and of class society as a whole.

Such consciousness does not emerge spontaneously from the day-to-day struggles of the working class, which do not in themselves challenge the capitalist mode of production, but must be brought into the proletariat from the outside, through the instrumentality of a revolutionary workers party. The forging of such a workers party will result from convulsive class battles and social protests and the intervention of Marxists who underline that the interests of labor are directly counterposed to those of the capitalist class. The support offered by the trade-union bureaucracy and its reformist left tails to even the most “progressive” capitalist politician represents not a step in that direction but a fundamental obstacle to the necessary political independence of the working class from its class enemies.

Reformists Debate How Best to Betray

Sanders is a capitalist politician, but the reformist left is ecstatic about him because he “got socialism on dinner tables across the country,” as Charles Lenchner of People for Bernie put it at the recent Left Forum in New York. Socialist Alternative (SAlt) spent months doing donkey work inside the Sanders campaign. Throughout the primaries, SAlt continued to issue pro-Sanders propaganda while suggesting politely that it might behoove him to run as an independent rather than as a Democrat.

As the end loomed, SAlt’s Seattle city council member Kshama Sawant launched a petition pleading with Sanders to run as an independent. She shamelessly suggested that “if electing a Republican is really Bernie’s main concern, there is no reason he could not at least run in the 40+ states where it’s absolutely clear the Democratic or Republican candidate will win, while not putting his name on the 5-10 closely contested ‘swing states’” (movement4bernie.org). In other words, according to SAlt’s scheme, even running as a supposed independent, Sanders wouldn’t threaten an electoral win for the Democrats. SAlt’s pleas to the contrary, Sanders made clear before, during and after the primary battle that he refused to play the role of “spoiler.”

In his June 16 webcast effectively conceding the nomination, Sanders announced: “The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly.” On June 24, he explicitly stated that he would vote for Clinton in November. Sanders’s fake-socialist backers are now left to figure out how to “fight the right” while trying to attract Bernie supporters repelled by the idea of voting for Clinton. Some of the contortions that result were on display at a May 21 debate at New York’s Left Forum between SAlt and the slightly more circumspect International Socialist Organization (ISO). The only substantive difference was whether to pressure the Democrats from inside or outside this capitalist party.

The ISO’s Jen Roesch zoomed in on how ridiculous it is for SAlt “to say you’re campaigning for Sanders, and supporting Sanders, but that you’re not helping to sign people up for the Democratic Party.” The ISO hastened to make clear that they, too, “felt the Bern.” As one ISOer put it, “Not endorsing Sanders has not stopped us from engaging with the campaign.” Like SAlt, Roesch made clear that the ISO’s main problem with Sanders is not his program or the class he represents, but only his running on the Democratic Party ticket.

During the discussion, a Spartacist supporter pointed to Sanders “supporting bloody American imperialism to the hilt,” a topic delicately avoided by the sundry reformists. He declared:

“Your debate is actually a farce because you both push illusions in bourgeois democracy, which is a screen for the brutal class exploitation inherent in capitalism; you both push illusions in incremental reforms of the capitalist state, which is fundamentally unreformable; and while you both talk about independence, for Marxists independence is a class question, and you both support capitalist politicians year after year, the ISO no less.”

While there is plenty to fear from a Trump presidency, to throw one’s vote to another competing capitalist politician is treason to the fight to defend the interests of working people and the oppressed.

In the end, both SAlt and the ISO came out for backing the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, as “a step toward building an alternative to the two-party system” (socialistworker.org, 25 May). The ISO has been deep in this small-time capitalist party for years. They not only campaigned for the anti-union populist Ralph Nader when he ran for president on its ticket in 2000, but also have themselves campaigned to be Green Party candidates (see “ISO Goes All the Way with Capitalist Greens,” WV No. 866, 17 March 2006). Although it may sound more radical than Sanders’s, the Green Party’s platform is nothing but bourgeois liberalism, devoted to a utopian-reactionary fantasy of small-scale capitalism hostile to economic growth.

For those disgruntled liberals who won’t hold their noses and vote for Clinton, the Greens provide a way station on the road back into the Democratic Party, typical of “progressive” bourgeois third parties in the U.S. An example can be found in 1948, as the Democratic Harry S. Truman administration was spearheading the anti-Soviet Cold War. Henry Wallace’s Progressive Party ran on a “pro-labor” stance and called for “friendship” with the Soviet Union. Wallace, who had been vice president under Franklin D. Roosevelt, was supported by the Stalinist Communist Party under the rubric of the “anti-monopoly” coalition.

James P. Cannon, the founder of American Trotskyism, refuted the argument that Henry Wallace was not a capitalist candidate because the capitalists did not support him. At a 1948 Central Committee plenum of the then-Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party, Cannon remarked:

“The class character of the party is determined first by its program; secondly by its actual policy in practice; and thirdly by its composition and control. The Wallace party is bourgeois on all these counts.... We have to stir up the workers against this imposter, and explain to them that they will never get a party of their own by accepting substitutes.”

For more on Wallace, see “On Bourgeois ‘Third Parties’ and the 1948 Henry Wallace Campaign,” WV No. 918, 1 August 2008.

The Fight for Socialism

While hypocritically condemning Trump’s racist poison against blacks, Muslims and immigrants, the Democrats are actually carrying out much of what he spouts. Obama has deported millions of immigrants, more than any other president. His warplanes, drones and special forces have butchered thousands (mainly Muslims) in the American “national interest,” while at home his administration has been leading the assault on democratic rights under the guise of the “war on terror.” Trump raves against China in the name of “America First,” but it is Obama who has slapped massive tariffs on Chinese steel and is ramping up military and economic pressure with the aim of destroying this most powerful of the remaining deformed workers states.

Unlike every other major industrialized country, the U.S. has never had a mass workers party representing even a deformed expression of the political independence of the proletariat. As Gore Vidal, the late great American author (and no Marxist), put it in 1972: “We have only one political party in the U.S., the Property Party, with two right wings, Republican and Democrat” (Imperial America, 2004).

The central enduring feature of American capitalism, shaping and perpetuating this backward consciousness, is the structural oppression of the black population as a race-color caste, the majority of which is forcibly segregated at the bottom of society. Black oppression, with its profound and pervasive ideological effects, is fundamental to the American capitalist order. Obscuring the fundamental class division between the capitalists who own the means of production and the working class who must sell their labor power to survive, racism and white supremacy have served to bind white workers to their capitalist exploiters with the illusion of a commonality of interest based on skin color.

Today the Black Lives Matter current is enmeshed in a strategy of lobbying the Democrats, whether Sanders or Clinton, in a futile attempt to reform the police—which exist precisely to enforce racist, capitalist rule. The road to black liberation lies rather through mobilizing the social power of the multiracial working class, which cannot liberate itself from wage slavery without fighting to end the racial oppression of black people. In this struggle, black workers, heavily represented in the most militant ranks of organized labor and forming a human link to the impoverished ghetto masses, are slated to play a leading role.

The party we fight for is a multiracial, internationalist, proletarian party capable of leading the working class, at the head of all the oppressed, in the struggle for a victorious socialist revolution. On an international scale, working-class rule would lay the material basis for a global society without classes, in which material plenty has made poverty a thing of the past, imperialist wars are no longer possible and race and ethnicity have ceased to have any social significance. Such a party will be forged over the political corpses of those who pervert “socialism” into a tool to defend the current outlived social order.

Verizon Labor Union Strike Beats Back Company Attack - Organize All Wireless Workers!,Liberal,2,4s1jui,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4s1jui/verizon_labor_union_strike_beats_back_company/,0,"Workers Vanguard No. 1092 1 July 2016

Verizon workers along the East Coast organized in the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) have voted overwhelmingly to ratify contracts agreed to at the end of their hard-fought seven-week strike this spring. The company had been out for blood against the unions, which are concentrated in the wireline (landline and FiOS broadband) division, aiming to further gut the shrinking union workforce. Instead, the strike forced Verizon to back down from its “last, best and final offer,” a litany of giveback demands ranging from pension concessions to attacks on job security that would have led to layoffs and more outsourcing.

The company was also forced to relent on work-rule changes that would have let management deploy workers far from their homes at whim. Several workers told Workers Vanguard that they were happy to see that the hated Quality Assurance Review (QAR) program, which the company had used to enforce discipline, was done away with. Undoubtedly the company will try to implement a new draconian discipline system that the workers have to be ready to confront; as one veteran union steward told WV, “You can have a contract and the company can violate it all the time. They always try that,” adding, “You always have to fight.”

In the end, the one big concession obtained by Verizon was hundreds of millions of dollars in health care cost savings. Union officials had offered this giveback long before the strike began. The additional cost to workers will eat up much of the 10.9 percent increase in wages agreed to over the four-year life of the contracts.

Verizon was also hell-bent on blocking union inroads into its highly profitable wireless sector, which is dependent on the infrastructure of the unionized wireline business but is virtually unorganized. The company had rebuffed all attempts at negotiation with nearly 80 retail workers in Brooklyn and Everett, Massachusetts, who voted for union representation by the CWA in 2014. Now, as a direct result of the strike, these workers have finally won their first contract, timed to expire with the wireline contracts and the contract of 100 wireless technicians who were already CWA members. This common expiration date backs up the handful of organized wireless workers with the leverage of the entire unionized workforce. Union tops say they “plan to build on this foothold” to unionize the wireless workers. In fact, if this Rottweiler of a company is to be kept at bay, every wireless worker must be organized, making all of Verizon a union shop. The future of the CWA and IBEW at Verizon is on the line.

But the strategy of the union bureaucrats is to rely on the agencies of the capitalist class enemy and its state, including mobilizing votes for Democratic politicians who would putatively appoint “pro-labor” officials to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). After the 2000 contract, union officials touted a “neutrality agreement” with Verizon that supposedly ensured that the company would not interfere in organizing efforts. But the bosses are never neutral when it comes to profits, and Verizon flouted that agreement from day one. After nearly 16 years of “neutrality,” the unions have managed to organize fewer than 200 wireless workers. It took a strike to win a contract for the wireless store workers, and it will take unions flexing their muscle and relying on their power and organization—not appeals to the capitalist government and the bosses—to organize and win decent contracts for Verizon’s 70,000 wireless workers.

The success of the Verizon strike demonstrates that the only way to repel the vicious attacks of the capitalist bosses is through class struggle. This point was underscored on the first day after the strike ended, when workers at multiple garages returned to work wearing the CWA’s signature red T-shirts instead of regulation Verizon gear. The color red is meant to memorialize CWA chief steward Gerry Horgan, a member killed on the picket lines in the 1989 strike when the daughter of a plant manager hit him with her car (see “CWA Striker Murdered on the Picket Line,” WV No. 484, 1 September 1989). Acting as if the recent strike had never happened, Verizon managers demanded that the workers take off the shirts. Instead, they walked out.

However, if the union tops have their way, that militancy will be channeled into stumping for the Democratic Party in the presidential elections. The pro-capitalist labor bureaucracy has time and time again pushed the strategy of electing “friend of labor” Democrats who, once in power, would supposedly act in the interest of the workers. In reality, this strategy has served to demobilize the power of the workers and their unions, resulting in one defeat after another and helping to lay the basis for the decimation of the unions.

Union officials timed the strike to coincide with the April primaries in New York and elsewhere on the East Coast. Last year, the outgoing president of the CWA, Larry Cohen, became a senior campaign adviser to Bernie Sanders. Months afterward, the CWA endorsed this capitalist politician who is touted as “socialist.” Both Sanders and Hillary Clinton stated that they supported the strike, though Clinton’s “support” was far more muted. Now, with the Sanders campaign folding, union members will be told that they must mobilize to defeat Republican reactionary Donald Trump at all costs—i.e., to vote for Clinton. But reliance on the Democrats, or on any capitalist party, is a losing strategy. The Democratic Party is a bosses party no less than the Republicans. Democratic claims to be the “friends of labor” are merely aimed at hoodwinking working people into supporting a party that represents the interests of the capitalist exploiters.

CWA and IBEW officials expressed gratitude that Obama’s labor secretary, Thomas Perez, and federal mediators got Verizon to negotiate with the unions. In fact, Perez only intervened because the strike was hurting Verizon’s bottom line. Despite months of preparation by the company, including training a scab army of 20,000 managers and non-union workers, the strike began to bite a few weeks in. The scabs did not have the skill sets to do the work of the strikers, and Verizon ran up a backlog of installs, new orders and customer complaints. The profit-hungry giant burned through cash reserves. With the strike hurting Verizon, Perez moved to broker negotiations to end the labor action and prevent further damage to the company. All the actions of the mediators were in the long-term interests of Verizon investors and the American capitalist class as a whole.

Or take the actions of the NLRB early on in this strike. When CWA pickets at hotels, backed up by Teamsters and honored by Hotel Trades Council members, caused scabs to be evicted from New York hotels from which they were being dispatched, the NLRB got a federal judge to slap the CWA with a picket ban. The capitalists’ labor boards, along with their courts and their cops, are on the side of the bosses. Having Democrats in power does not change this basic truth.

Speaking to Jacobin (15 June), CWA political director Bob Master told a rather telling joke: “Remind us never to go on strike again unless it’s a week before a contested New York primary when a socialist is running for president.” In reality, it was the defiance and resolution of the 39,000 striking workers that staved off Verizon’s anti-union assault. Picketers remained determined to fight and win, despite having their health insurance cut off by the company and experiencing up close and personal the scabherding by the police, for whom strikebreaking is a job description.

The political program of the union bureaucracy is based on the lie that there is a “partnership” between the workers and their capitalist class enemies. At bottom, these misleaders promote the myth that capitalism can be “fair” to working people, and that companies like Verizon should give workers their “fair share.” But capitalism is a system of production for profit, and that profit comes from the exploitation of the working class. That’s why Verizon has been determined to scuttle organizing efforts of its wireless workers: the weaker the unions, the lower the wages and benefits, the greater the profits.

The company did not win this battle. But as American Trotskyist leader James P. Cannon, who played a key role in the 1934 victory of the Minneapolis Teamsters strikes, observed in 1936, any settlement between the employers and the workers “is only a temporary truce and the nature of such a settlement is decided by power” (see Notebook of an Agitator, 1958). The four-year contracts between Verizon and the unions represent such a truce between two forces whose interests are irreconcilable. Skirmishes between the workers and the bosses will continue, whether there is a piece of paper with signatures on it or not.

What’s key is the relative strength of the opposing forces, and this depends in large part on the leadership of the unions. The track record of the CWA and IBEW labor bureaucrats is written in the contracts themselves, each of which preserves the core of previous settlements. Like many labor agreements, they carry a no-strike clause forbidding labor action until the contract expires. This shackles the membership’s ability to defend itself, and the workers should fight to scrap it. Even when contracts expire—along with their no-strike clauses—the union bureaucrats try mightily to avert strikes. When Verizon workers went on strike in 2011, the labor tops sent them back to work after two weeks without a contract. When the last contract expired in August, the workers were itching to strike but the union misleaders held them back until April. This time around, the workers were brought back to work before voting on the contract, or even seeing it.

The union tops point to the promised creation of 1,300 new union call center jobs, which were won in exchange for granting management more flexibility in routing customer calls. Assuming the company even creates these jobs, they will come with a big asterisk. In the 2003 and 2012 contracts, the CWA and IBEW negotiators made concessions that created a second tier for new hires. At the time, Verizon was not hiring. But now new jobs will fall into the second tier. New hires will not enjoy the same job security provisions as existing workers. Even if they make it to retirement, they would not receive retiree health care—instead, getting a stipend—nor would they get the defined benefit pension that retirees who were on the payroll in 2003 get. The bureaucrats have built in the basis for corrosive divisions in the ranks, which will be an obstacle to future organizing. What is vital is for the unions to fight for equal pay and benefits for equal work.

America’s union movement can only be rebuilt through persistent, clear-eyed class battles waged against the bosses, with no illusions in the capitalists’ parties and their state. It will be in the course of such battles that union militants will be able to forge a new, class-struggle leadership in the unions. Such a leadership will be crucial in the building of a workers party that fights for a workers government, whose task will be to expropriate the capitalist exploiters and build a planned, socialist economy. Those who labor must rule!

JUNE 24 — Standing on our consistent record of proletarian, revolutionary and internationalist opposition to the imperialist-dominated European Union (EU), the Spartacist League/Britain welcomes the decisive vote for a British exit. This is a stunning defeat for the City of London, for the bosses and bankers of Europe as a whole as well as for Wall Street and the US imperialist government. The vote to leave is an expression of hostility from the downtrodden and dispossessed not only to the EU but to the smug British ruling establishment, whose devastation of social services and industry has plunged whole sections of the proletariat into penury.

As we wrote in Workers Hammer (no 234, Spring 2016), calling for a leave vote : “Amid the growing chaos besetting the EU, a British exit would deal a real blow to this imperialist-dominated conglomerate, further destabilising it and creating more favourable conditions for working-class struggle across Europe — including against a weakened and discredited Tory government in Britain. But the failure of Labour and the trade union bureaucracy — like the social democrats and trade union misleaders throughout Europe — to mobilise against the EU has instead ceded the oppositional ground to openly anti-immigrant reactionaries and fascists.”

With anti-EU sentiment running high among working people in France, Spain, Italy and Greece, the vote for Brexit will encourage opposition to the EU elsewhere in Europe. The main purpose of the EU is to maximise the profits of the imperialist ruling classes at the expense of the workers, from Germany to Greece, and of the weaker countries of Europe. The exit of British imperialism could sound the death knell for this inherently unstable capitalist club. Down with the EU! For workers revolution to smash capitalist rule! For a Socialist United States of Europe!

The far right and fascist forces — including UKIP in Britain and the National Front in France — are today rejoicing over “their” victory. UKIP blatantly whipped up vile anti-immigrant racism, including with a disgusting poster implying that thousands of dark-skinned refugees were at Britain’s door. But UKIP hardly has a monopoly on racism: Cameron invoked the spectre of migrant camps similar to the Calais “Jungle” in France moving to England in the event of a British exit. And Labour governments have whipped up anti-immigrant racism just like the Tories. We say: No deportations! Full citizenship rights for all who make it to Britain! Down with racist Fortress Europe!

Those who voted for Brexit did so for a variety of reasons. But only the wilfully blind in the workers movement will see the vote for Brexit as simply a boost for UKIP and the Tory right wing. Cameron has resigned, the Conservatives have been bitterly divided, the capitalist rulers of Europe are in shock. The time is ripe for workers struggles to begin to claw back decades of concessions to the bourgeoisie on wages, working conditions and trade union rights by the reformist union bureaucrats. For a start, the multinational and multiethnic workforce of the NHS should tear up the wretched agreement imposed on junior doctors and mobilise to fight for a revitalised and expanded national health service to provide quality care to all totally free at the point of service. At least the junior doctors fought, unlike Len McCluskey and the rest of the pro-capitalist trade union tops who refused even to mobilise their ranks to fight Cameron’s pernicious new anti-union law. What is needed is a fight for a class-struggle leadership of the unions.

In the wake of the EU’s ravaging of Greece, the “left” Brexit camp, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the Socialist Party offered a half-hearted campaign for a leave vote. From their reformist “old Labour” standpoint, the EU is a barrier to achieving their maximum programme: renationalising British industry under a left Labour government. Faced with closures of the steel plants, this ultimately boils down to a protectionist call to “save British jobs”, which fuels anti-foreigner chauvinism and is counterposed to a class-struggle perspective. The morning after the Brexit vote, the SWP’s crowning demand is: Tories out — for a general election.

A year ago, the same outrage and discontent at the base of society that propelled the vote to leave the EU also fuelled the election of Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party, opening the possibility of reforging Labour’s historic links to its working-class base and thus reversing two decades of Blairite schemes to turn Labour into an outright capitalist party. But in campaigning for a remain vote, Corbyn trampled on the interests of the many working people and minorities who looked to him for a change. Crime does not pay: when the results of the referendum came in, Corbyn’s enemies began plotting to remove him from the leadership as soon as possible. It is in the interests of the working class to repulse any and every attempt by Labour’s right wing to regain control of the party.

Today the country is divided — by class, and along regional and national lines. England — outside London — and Wales voted to leave the EU. A majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain, reflecting fears among Catholics that border controls between North and South would be reinstituted. Scotland too voted to remain in the EU, and the SNP has declared that a second referendum on independence is on the agenda. The bourgeois nationalist SNP are committed to maintaining an “independent” Scotland’s membership of the major Western imperialist clubs — the NATO military alliance and the EU. Corbyn’s capitulation to the imperialist EU has deprived working-class opposition to the EU in Scotland (and elsewhere) of a political voice.

The Brexit vote is the second time in the space of a year that the working masses in Europe have voted to repudiate the EU. Last July’s vote in Greece against EU austerity was utterly betrayed by the bourgeois Syriza government, which crawled on its knees before the European banks. The burning question posed is what kind of party does the working class need to represent its interests. The fundamental problems facing the working class cannot be solved within a parliamentary framework. We need a government based on workers councils, which expropriates the capitalist class.

As part of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) we seek to build revolutionary workers parties, in Britain and around the world, rooted in the understanding that only through the mass mobilisation of the working class in struggle can the workers fight for their own interests and act in defence of all the oppressed. Socialist revolutions especially in the economically developed countries of Europe, including Britain, will establish rationally planned economies based on an international division of labour. The overthrow of the capitalist ruling classes and the development of the productive forces under a socialist united states of Europe will open the road to a global socialist society.

Killer Capitalist Sentenced to Country Club - 2010 West Virginia Mine Disaster,Liberal,1,4niaqy,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4niaqy/killer_capitalist_sentenced_to_country_club_2010/,0,"On May 12, some six years after a fiery explosion at Upper Big Branch (UBB) mine in West Virginia snuffed out the lives of 29 miners, former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship walked into prison to serve a one-year sentence for conspiracy to willfully violate mine safety standards. Blankenship was acquitted of securities fraud and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could have carried a sentence of 30 years. To the bosses and their courts, lying to Wall St. is a far greater crime than causing the death of nearly 30 miners. In fact, Blankenship will be spending his time at a “Club Fed”—a privately run minimum security facility in California that boasts an unfenced, campus-like environment with a sports complex and a music department.

The 5 April 2010 disaster at UBB was capitalist industrial murder. In the month preceding it, the mine logged 50 safety violations, many related to ventilation. Of those who died that day, 71 percent had signs of incurable black lung disease. Three separate investigations afterward concluded that the deadly combination of methane gas and highly combustible coal dust was the cause of the explosion. Survivors reported that workers who tried to get dangerous conditions addressed were ignored, threatened or told to tamper with the monitoring equipment. A union safety committee could have stopped work at UBB. But there was no union at UBB.

For coal operators like Massey Energy, accumulating violations and fines is just part of the cost of doing business—and cheaper than installing necessary ventilation and safety equipment. Every cited violation is challenged, and until it is settled, the company pays nothing while the government’s limp Mine Safety and Health Administration investigates. This agency does not exist to protect workers but to lull them into believing that government agencies can be relied on to defend their interests. As Blankenship’s sentence demonstrates, the capitalist government, including its courts and agencies, exists to defend the interests of the bosses against working people.

UBB was Massey Energy’s premier money-making mine, and Blankenship made it his personal business to keep out the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). In face-to-face meetings he bullied workers and threatened to close the mine; the UMWA was defeated three times, despite the fact that 70 percent of the workers had signed union cards.

Blankenship is a notorious overlord in a notoriously brutal industry. As a district manager in the 1980s, he was an architect of a vicious, union-busting strategy to push the UMWA into bargaining separately with each subsidiary; isolated strikes were then defeated with a combination of state troopers and bought-and-paid-for judges as well as armies of mercenaries, attack dogs and scabs. Entire mining communities were put under siege during months-long strikes. While he was CEO of Massey Energy, 52 miners were killed.

The UMWA bureaucracy, both under the leadership of current AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka and today under Cecil Roberts, did not respond to these attacks with the historic weapons of the union: solid picket lines and the strategy of “one out all out” until an industry-wide settlement is reached. Instead, they pursued the losing scheme of selective strikes, individual acts of civil disobedience and lawsuits. At the same time, the UMWA leadership did not defend union militants singled out by the government for victimization.

In 1987, the UMWA tops deserted four Kentucky miners, including Donnie Thornsbury, a local president, who were framed up for the shooting death of a scab. They received sentences of 35 to 45 years, and Thornsbury remained in prison until 2010. Likewise, in 1993, Jerry Dale Lowe, a safety committeeman from Logan County, West Virginia, was abandoned to face eleven years without possibility of parole for “interfering with interstate commerce.” Contrast these vindictive sentences to the slap on the wrist given to Blankenship!

The grieving families of the 29 UBB miners, along with those of the 23 other victims killed in Massey mines under Blankenship’s control, will not see justice in the capitalist courts. Something approaching justice for Blankenship could only come from a workers tribunal. What’s desperately needed is the forging of a new, class-struggle leadership in the union, which must be part of a fight to build a revolutionary workers party that can lead the assault on this bloodthirsty capitalist system.

"Been dreaming up a new political system, curious if it was popular here?",Liberal,2,3jugy2,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/3jugy2/been_dreaming_up_a_new_political_system_curious/,0,"I don't have much experience with politics but have been constructing this idea of a new system based on what seems most natural to me. People dislike the notion that a few hundred have the power to control millions. There isn't much of a way around this, but it should be possible to create a political system and government that better represents the populous, and more precisely to represent our best selves. My version of this “proportional representation” is as follows:

Everyone comes together to form groups of between one and three hundred people. These groups are geographically based and so every four years one must attend a local hall with your ""roughly"" 150 neighbours and vote on two representatives, largest proportion of votes wins. Understandably, fewer groups would be 'based' in rural Scotland than groups based in cities, per square mile.

The second step is how the political system is thus built upon this foundation. Assuming an average size of 150 people per group, in the UK there would be 400,000 groups, and these would be gathered into clumps of 10, each clump representing 10 neighbouring groups, and so about 1500 people. The two elected representatives of each group would come together and the twenty of them would represent the 2000 part time. This is the first rung/tier of the political system and the twenty of them would act as a sort of neighbourhood leader. Every four years they would vote for two of them to move to the next rung.

This second tier would form after 10 neighbouring pairs of ""first tier representatives"" came together and the twenty representatives would represent their collective 15,000. This second tier, would be paid a decent salary, would fulfil a role similar to an mp or district/county council, and serve a 4 year spell. The twenty men/women in the second tier would also vote for two of them to go on to represent in the third tier.

The third tier: This would constitute the two representatives of ten second tier groups coming together and representing their collective 150,000 people. Finally, the twenty in the third tier would nominate 1 person to enter a final tier of around 400 people. These 400 people would hold a position that could be comparable to the present-day government. The 400 would be composed of two groups of 200, in the UK there would be a northern group and a southern group. This is where the normal citizens can vote again. 5 representatives from each group of 200 will campaign much like the present day system and two of them will be voted through to fulfil the figurehead/leader role.

(Oh and the thing about pairs acting as representatives of the populous was partly inspired by the Roman democracy before the Emperors became a thing. They always had two heads of states, which yes seems ridiculous at first glance but apparently led to more balanced and wiser decision making. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul)

So everyone will have roots/access to those in power, it would be much more connected. Any thoughts or comments would be very interesting :) In my eyes this is true democracy, and I would love to see the sort of people who would end up making the societal decisions in this system, compared to who we have presently.",1441537615.0

Communist Inc. - Has it been tried?,Liberal,4,pal8w,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/pal8w/communist_inc_has_it_been_tried/,5,"Not trolling.

This was probably already covered somewhere (and if so a link would be cool)...

Why wouldn't Communist in, say the USA, start their own corporation. Let's say it has x billion shares (tax purposes - need to hand out the shares before they gain value).

Each share is non-transferable, already distributed and in-active until activated by the owner of the share (other rules could apply). At anytime a person can de-active (and of course re-activate) their share as they see fit (all logistics easily computerized).

Initially, the corporation could purchase existing manufacturing companies in areas that have over-capacity. For example, a toilet paper factory. Hopefully, in this example, this would provide toilet paper for all company owners who have activated their share: you never have to buy toilet paper again. Why over capacity? Because you can get a good deal on these types of factories. Those people working at the existing factory have their share activated meaning they now own the factory they work in (more complex than this cause they would still need to be paid in some manner but this is the basic idea).

What assets to purchase next would be determined by a vote of active share holders (again, logistics which can be computerized).

Over the years, Communist Inc. could own car manufacturing facilities, logistic companies, dentist offices, hospitals, schools, air lines, mass transit systems, etc. Cars, as an example, manufactured would belong to Communist Inc. and be usable by everyone (if they even decide to make cars: maybe mass transit is better, etc.). Communist Inc. could even sell those cars to people that have not activated providing Communist Inc. with more capital.

Hopefully, at some point, the needs of all those within Communist Inc. would be fully covered by the corporation and being the company is owned by everyone equally, there is no chance of one person gaining enough power to become corrupted.

Just a though from a few nights ago.

Though, now that I write this out, it all sounds kinda silly. Hmm.",1328360696.0

CCR EXPLAINS HLP v. HOLDER: NATIONAL CALL FOR SOLIDARITY ACTIVISTS AND AID WORKERS

 

Are you involved in international solidarity organizing, conflict resolution, or humanitarian aid work?

 

Are you worried that the recent Supreme Court decision about the “material support” statute in Humanitarian Law Project v. Holder (HLP) might criminalize your peace work?

 

Do you have questions about how recent FBI raids on solidarity activists might relate to you?

 

The Center for Constitutional Rights, the human rights organization that litigated HLP up to the Supreme Court, is holding a series of calls for activists and humanitarian aid workers who are concerned and have questions. CCR attorneys will give an overview of the decision and its implications and answer questions that are emailed in to them. Please join us for the first call:

Participant Access Code: 413502#

 

We request your RSVP and questions in advance. Send to: events@ccrjustice.org with “HLP RSVP” or “HLP question” in the subject line.

Background on Humanitarian Law Project v. Holder

 

CCR challenged sections of the “material support” statute (18 U.S.C. § 2339B) on behalf of various groups and individuals who had provided and wanted to continue providing  nonviolent dispute resolution training, humanitarian aid, and other similar services to foreign organizations on the State Department’s designated terrorist list. CCR argued that these sections of the material support statute violated the First Amendment and criminalized lawful and non-violent activities that might actually promote solutions to conflicts.

 

While multiple lower courts had found language in the material support statute to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, last June the Supreme Court overturned these decisions, finding the law to be constitutional. The Court allowed the vague language to remain in the statute, raising concern that peaceful solidarity and humanitarian work could be criminalized.

 

Since this Supreme Court decision, various groups doing international solidarity work or providing humanitarian aid have sought to understand how it could impact them.  Concerns have only heightened since the September 2010 FBI raids on Palestine and Colombia solidarity activists and the recent reactivation of subpoenas investigating their activities.

 

CCR will be hosting a series of calls where activists, aid workers, and others can submit questions via email and get answers from our attorneys regarding the Supreme Court’s Humanitarian Law Project decision and its implications.

 

Know your rights.  Please join us for the first call on Wednesday, December 8 at 5pm EST.

 

For more information, including a video of CCR attorney Shane Kadidal explaining the HLP case, please see our case page:

Take Over and the Hope for Revolution in the US",Liberal,3,b42rv,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/b42rv/right_wing_populism_the_possibility_of_a_right/,0,"I think a little materialist analysis on the current state of US politics is in order. I propose a discusion thread here, in order to get different viewpoints.

During the 2004 presidential race the Revolutionary Communist Party had an interesting analysis. Basically it predicted that the Republicans would be successful in the theft of the election because hte Democrats would refuse to activate and call out their base into the streets election night. Generally this came true, Ohio was stolen, the Democrats, for fear of their base, and not wanting to begin a ""arms race"" of activist from both parties, as well as a fear of losing control of the base, they refused to call out their people.

Jump to the Obama election and there, they truly called their people out in every major city in the US. 250,000 in Chicago, 40k in DC, 50k in NYC, etc. THe Republicans had no hope of pulling off a theft of the election, major riots and a coup may have occurred. 

Thus the green light for calling out the most wild lunatics you can imagine was given. The right called them out. Groups like the OathKeepers (which many on the left seem to identify with, they are a group of active military that swear to uphold the constitution, in reality they decide the constitutionality of what they decide.) the TEA Partiers, and many others, the rise of rhetoric and populism has taken hold, mixed with conspircism and demogogary the proletariate have been bombarded with.

Does this constitute the possibility for a truly fascist takeover, either by the military in the US, or through continued legislation? Will that make it easier to activate and bring forward people to a communist world of liberation and the end of oppression?

What is the Capitalist view of Distributism?,Conservative,3,r39i4e,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/r39i4e/what_is_the_capitalist_view_of_distributism/,1,"Distributism (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of Catholic social teaching, especially the teachings of Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical Rerum Novarum and Pope Pius XI in Quadragesimo Anno.

According to distributists, property ownership is a fundamental right and the means of production should be spread as widely as possible rather than being centralized under the control of the state (state socialism), a few individuals (plutocracy), or corporations (corporatocracy). Distributism therefore advocates a society marked by widespread property ownership.

Co-operative economist Race Mathews, argues such a system is key to bringing about a just social order.

Distributism has often been described in opposition to both socialism and capitalism,which distributists see as equally flawed and exploitative. Thomas Storck argues that “both socialism and capitalism are products of the European Enlightenment and are thus modernizing and anti-traditional forces. Further, some distributists argue that socialism is the logical conclusion of capitalism as capitalism’s concentrated powers eventually capture the state, resulting in a form of socialism. In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life”.",1638003114.0

Why are wealthy companies subsidized?,Conservative,14,r1f4f3,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/r1f4f3/why_are_wealthy_companies_subsidized/,33,"I'm coming at this from the angle of a liberal capitalist, who believes that a well-regulated capitalist system brings about the most net good for society. I furthermore believe that crony capitalism is a drain on society on multiple levels.

It's no secret that the US federal government (as well as state and local governments) [spends richly on subsidies](https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/subsidy-tracker) for businesses both public and private. Some of these subsidies can even be argued to be a net good, such as subsidizing certain clean energies or technological innovation. However, I can't get over the fact that multi-billion dollar corporations like [Amazon](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/amazoncom), [Boeing](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/boeing), and [Google](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/alphabet-inc) receive supplemental income despite being in no danger of going bankrupt.

Is there any good reason for large, wealthy, and essentially safe companies to be receiving money from the government, or is this merely crony capitalism at work?",1637787712.0

&#x200B;

""If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out."" -

[https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders)

&#x200B;

In the letter he pretty much outlined what Amazon has accomplished so far:

1. Pioneered cloud computing almost a decade before any of the other tech giants (Google, Microsoft)... Which has allowed other companies (Reddit) to grow and scale to where they are today.
2. Has given small companies and businesses the same compute resources as a giant tech company via AWS.
3. Has given people a lot of their time back that they would’ve had to spend running errands like grocery shopping. That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.
4. Has employed over 1.5 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $18/hr and good health benefits. Amazon’s net profits in 2020 was around 21 billion dollars. They pay their employees 90 billion dollars in wages and other benefits.
5. Yeah Amazon’s founder has 180bn net worth. But by founding and spearheading Amazon, he also created \~1.6 trillion dollars worth of wealth for other people (Amazon’s total market cap is at 1.8 trillion dollars). A large portion of that wealth are in pension funds, 401Ks, and Universities.

&#x200B;

Overall I think the reason why I think a lot of people hate him and Musk is due to something called crab mentality:

&#x200B;

""Crab mentality, also known as crab theory, crabs in a bucket (also barrel, basket, or pot) mentality, or the crab-bucket effect, is a way of thinking best described by the phrase ""if I can't have it, neither can you"". The metaphor is derived from a pattern of behavior noted in crabs when they are trapped in a bucket. While any one crab could easily escape, its efforts will be undermined by others, ensuring the group's collective demise.

&#x200B;

**The analogy in human behavior is claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to reduce the self-confidence of any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, resentment, spite, conspiracy, or competitive feelings, to halt their progress.""**

&#x200B;

That's why a long time ago people were fanboying over Elon Musk when he was in 15-20th place. But as soon as he became the richest person on Earth suddenly everyone wants him to fail now. And that he and Bezos should stop focusing on space travel and instead donate that money to other people.",1637639720.0

               “The lower strata of the middle class — the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen 
           and peasants — all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which 
            Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialised skill is 
            rendered worthless by new methods of production.”

Powerful companies, concentrations of wealth, and new methods of production make it increasingly difficult for independent professionals and middle-class merchants to maintain their status.   They end up with the wrong skill set or working for companies that have put their kind out of business.     In other words,  Marx anticipated the Walmartification of capitalist societies.

Marx did not simply dismiss capitalism. He was impressed by it. He argued that it has been the most productive system that the world has seen: 

                 “The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than 
            have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and 
            agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole 
             populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the 
            lap of social labour?”

A capitalist way to address capitalist problems,Conservative,9,qu99jt,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qu99jt/a_capitalist_way_to_address_capitalist_problems/,10,"Most of you on here are not a big fan of taxes and understandably so. A fact that far too few leftists are willing to acknowledge is that just about every tax carries a deadweight loss. At the same time, we still need the government to pay for basic essentials like infrastructure, law enforcement, and military expenses.

Furthermore, we are seeing rising housing costs which are keeping today's young people from being able to afford to own homes like generations before.

So what's the solution?

In order to really be able to discuss solutions, we need to understand just where the problem comes from.

To do that, we need to understand the three factors of production.

Labor: effort by man

Capital: Most goods fall under here

Land: Any good in fixed supply like land, space, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and geostationary orbits. While labor and capital have a potentially unlimited potential, land, being fixed in supply, cannot be increased.

Profit is likewise split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land). The traditional American idea is that by working harder, you improve your living standards while also benefitting society. There are two economic activities which benefit society - labor and investment. The former is typically what most people mean when they say work hard but investment can potentially take you much further than the former. That's why business owners and C-level people make so much money. And this is probably the biggest issue with Marx's labor theory of value. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't state that labor is the only thing which grows the economy but rather that labor is the only productive economic activity. Land and capital most certainly exist but they take on passive roles according to Marx. The factors of production, according to marxian economics, are labor, subjects of labor (land), and tools of labor (capital). According to the LTV, all goods and services derive their worth from labor costs (more specifically, socially necessary labor). The problem with the LTV is that it ignores investment as a way to contribute to the economy. Compared to labor, investment is less effort and more risk. Half of all businesses fail within the first five years with 20% failing in the first year. Some socialists go yet even further and state that all labor is worth the same with the only differential factor being number of hours worked. Just to be clear here, Marx himself did not believe this but others like Pierre Joseph Proudhon did. Proudhon proposed the idea of labor notes. The problem with this idea becomes obvious when you consider the disparity in skill required to become a janitor vs a brain surgeon. If everyone were paid the same, there would be a significant disparity in high skill labor.

This is probably the best video against socialism because it undermines the idea that labor alone creates wealth.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jUSDgolz7g&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jUSDgolz7g&t)

Which brings us to the big issue. You see, there's a form of investing that doesn't create wealth called speculation. If you buy an artwork for $150 only to later sell it for a million dollars because people now know that it was painted by someone noteworthy, you just made money without contributing to society. This isn't to say that speculation is entirely bad. In a volatile goods market, speculation can help to stabilize prices. But in markets where demand is rising faster than supply, speculation becomes easy. Markets with inelastic supply are particularly prone to this. One example is with artworks. With the kinds of artworks that sell for millions of dollars, most of their worth isn't in the artwork itself but in who painted it. Because these artworks are limited in supply and there's always someone who wants the original, they will sell for a lot of money.

It's in land that we see the pernicious effects of speculation. As you're starting to see, rent is unearned, unlike interest and wages because they reward the owner for essentially doing nothing. You might say the same with any investment since it grows passively. But the difference between investing in land and other things is that the growth in land value does not benefit society as a whole unlike growth in a business. Now obviously this doesn't mean that real estate investment is a scam. But there are differences. Real estate development creates capital. Buying land in the hopes that it will be worth more in the future does not generate any wealth. Land is in fixed supply giving it a perfectly inelastic supply. When it comes to demand, land is also pretty inelastic because we need land to live and work on. As a result, the amount that is charged for the selling and renting of land is pretty close to what people are willing to pay.

Land speculation is attractive because it offers a good reward with less risk when compared to other forms of investment such as starting a business or buying stocks. This is perhaps one of the reasons why housing is in short supply. Another reason is because municipal governments implement zoning codes which help prevent land from being used at its economic potential. This is a huge problem in the Bay Area where demand far outstrips supply. For a super liberal area, San Francisco does a terrible job of ensuring housing for all.

The good news is that there is a way to solve this issue. Meet the land value tax (LVT). The LVT is similar to a property tax except it only taxes the land rather than the improvements. Thus making improvements to your home will not give you a higher LVT. The LVT penalizes land speculation and incentivizes efficient use of land, making the LVT have a positive effect on the economy. If implemented at the state or federal level, it could also force municipal jurisdictions to rezone as the same people who push against new development would have no choice but to get them to change their zoning codes.

This idea is nothing new, it dates back to Henry George from the late 19th century. In *Progress and Poverty*, George detailed how land rent was the big issue with capitalism. His solution was the LVT. The idea was to raise the tax as high as it possibly could and use the surplus revenue to hand back to society in the form of a basic income. George was also pro free trade and was skeptical of intellectual property since that effectively granted a monopoly to the IP holder.

The idea dates back even further to Adam Smith who pointed out that land rent is unearned. Therefore, it's only fair for the government to raise revenue from taxing land value. Thomas Paine had a similar proposal to George in which land value would be taxed with 2/3 of proceeds being distributed to those over 50 (back then the average life expectancy) and the remaining third given to those under 50.

Milton Friedman considered the LVT to be the least bad tax

[https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes)

One objection to the LVT is that it would put land in the hands of the government. My rebuttal is that the same could be said for any tax. An income tax is the government claiming ownership over your labor (i.e. slavery). By that logic, a property tax puts all municipal property under the ownership of the city government. If you still think that the LVT is socialist, perhaps you ought to learn what actual socialists thought of the idea such as Karl Marx. In short, socialists like Marx didn't like George because the latter was going after land rent while leaving capital alone.

[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81\_06\_20.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81_06_20.htm)

Another objection is that this will negatively affect farmers. It's easy to think this because farmers grow stuff out of the ground, therefor the LVT will be punitive. However, you have to remember that we're talking about a land value tax, not a mere land tax. This means that land in better locations will be valued more than those in more remote locations. In other words, land near the city center would be taxed at a much higher rate than land in the rural areas. If the LVT would hit any sector of the economy the hardest, it would probably be big retainers with their massive parking lots.

The third objection is that renters won't really benefit because landlords will simply shift the cost onto tenants. But as mentioned before, renters are already paying close to what they would be willing to pay (assuming there's no rent control). In other words, landlords can't raise rents because they would have otherwise done so already. For some reason, we don't assume this about other taxes. If we lower taxes, people have more spending power, therefore, landlords raise rents because people can now afford to pay more.

In conclusion, the LVT is a conservative solution to the housing crisis and to taxation because it will benefit the economy and make it easier for the younger generation to achieve the American dream.",1636954945.0
Handouts for the billionaires with our taxes.....,Conservative,40,qu4n3t,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qu4n3t/handouts_for_the_billionaires_with_our_taxes/,22,"            “Without taxpayer support, however, neither Tesla nor SpaceX would have survived this long, and investors never would have had the 
              chance to make massive bets on both companies.”

That allowed the company to show profits sooner than it would have without the credits, lifting the value of the stock. In fact it wasn't until the second quarter this year that Tesla reported more in net income than it got from regulatory credit sales. ""It was really US taxpayers that helped get him through his roughest time,"" said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities who is a bull on Tesla shares — today. In 2019, he was still skeptical as the company struggled. ""If it didn't have regulatory credits, Tesla would not be the brand it is around the globe, and Musk wouldn't be the richest person in the world,"" Ives said.

Tesla buyers received total federal tax credits worth an estimated $3.4 billion before the perk disappeared entirely at the end of 2019. Even if that only allowed Tesla to raise prices by half that amount, that's another $1.7 billion in federal help, on top of the $5 billion it has received— so far — from regulatory credit sales.

And then there's SpaceX, which is a smaller but still significant source of Musk's wealth. The taxpayer support for this venture is even more clear, since it comes in the form of direct government contracts that are worth billions. According to Sam.gov, the government database that tracks federal spending, Space X has signed contracts worth nearly $10 billion. None was more crucial than the one the company received just before Christmas in 2008, when Space X and Musk were both virtually out of cash.

“They were right on the edge of insolvency,"" Dreier said. ""Elon has pointed out at that moment they were on the edge and that helped to save the company."" Dreier said the ISS and other contracts have worked out well for NASA, too, allowing the agency to use SpaceX rather than relying on the Russians to transport US astronauts. SpaceX has since gotten numerous additional government contracts from NASA, the military and other US government agencies. It won a $3 billion contract to develop the next vehicle to carry astronauts to the surface of the moon. And Dreier said SpaceX and other NASA contractors also benefit from the agency's in-kind support, including access to NASA employees and expertise.”

>In economics, many problems involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods is determined by the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization

> planned obsolescence (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life or a purposely frail design, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain pre-determined period of time upon which it decrementally functions or suddenly ceases to function, or might be perceived as unfashionable. The rationale behind this strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as ""shortening the replacement cycle""). It is the deliberate shortening of a lifespan of a product to force people to purchase functional replacements.

>Planned obsolescence tends to work best when a producer has at least an oligopoly. Before introducing a planned obsolescence, the producer has to know that the customer is at least somewhat likely to buy a replacement from them (see brand loyalty). In these cases of planned obsolescence, there is an information asymmetry between the producer, who knows how long the product was designed to last, and the customer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence


Note that even if a product manufacturer wants the product to last a reasonably long time, it is impossible for a product to last forever, and any product design optimized too heavily toward lifespan is likely to sacrifice more important factors. Even a very skilled engineer cannot guarantee high value for the consumer by simply sacrificing profit or maximizing any set of desirable factors. Further, some important economic ideas, such as ""externalities"" and ""goodwill,"" cannot be factored into most engineering calculations.


Many introductory books on capitalism suggest the profit is the only objective that must be optimized in any capitalist system. However, in any system with product design, the profit derived from a product is only one technical consideration. Some superficial proponents of capitalism sometimes argue that capitalism is the only system that works, and any system that is not profitable must be discarded immediately. However, in practice, capitalist factory owners are often willing to sink money into very costly product development campaigns that lose money for years.


Even though profits can be optimized in the short run, this can lead to ""wreck it and run"" management, in which a new manager takes over a company, throws it into chaos to jack up the stock price temporarily, takes profits by selling stock, and then retires with a golden parachute while the company crashes and burns.


Here is my modest proposal for people who advocate capitalism: be cautious of saying, ""Profit is the most important thing,"" or ""The rights of the shareholders are the only important rights.""",1636782198.0
"Because definitions of capitalist terms are always approximate, authorities who give definitions should also supply examples",Conservative,4,qsu1un,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qsu1un/because_definitions_of_capitalist_terms_are/,2,"When discussing a complex idea with a sympathetic collaborator, one must have clear definitions and unambiguously shared interpretations; otherwise nothing can begin. Unfortunately, the methods that are necessary for discussing complex topics with sympathetic audiences fail when discussing those same topics with hostile audiences.

Debates about complex topics are often unproductive because two or more sets of hostile participants do not share any clear set of definitions and interpretations. Even when the definitions appear to be terse and simple, the participants often interpret the definitions very differently. In the worst case scenario, opportunistic parasites prefer the confusion to any kind of productive debate and resort to emotion-provoking tactics to prevent debate and waste the resources of those who hope to debate.

By contrast, people who start from concrete examples may succeed in provoking unemotional and constructive debate. Example:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/ntmg0a/the_lie_and_myth_of_nordic_socialism_debunked/

The original post of that thread has many flaws and I suspect I would disagree with the author, but at least the examples of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Kerala are clearly presented. If I doubt the author's facts, I can double-check the examples easily enough.   I believe the key point of the original author's discussion takes the form of his definition:

>**Nordic socialism** means deceptive politicians claiming paternity to good developments due to exogenous factors

For general purposes of technical communication, the lesson to be learned is that one must present a large, orderly set of interesting, relevant facts before one can get the audience to seriously consider a controversial definition. For the specific academic purpose of discussions related to capitalism, I am convinced of three lessons:

**Lesson 1**) Some key terms are going to be contentious and the best we can hope for is to chip away on their margins. The author could not hope to get people to agree on what ""socialism"" means but he could at least propose his definition for ""Nordic socialism""-- i.e. the phenomenon that exists when welfare state measures thrive on a foundation of prosperity laid by much older trends of productivity and conscientiousness.

**Lesson 2**) Distinctions between formal governments and state-owned corporations muddy the waters considerably. Example dispute: 

Point:

>Scandinavian governments don't own the means of production whatsoever. They own no factories or farms.

Counterpoint:

>They may not own any means of production but they sure seem to get very high monthly dividends (through company, sales and income taxes), so what's the difference? Either way, you get your share of the profits of the company. The ownership distinction is theoretical.

**Lesson 3**) The Protestant work ethic, or something very much like it, seems to be at the root of the ""classical liberalism"" that started Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Kerala on their respective roads to their current levels of prosperity.

         The fact remains: “it should be their choice,”   Judge Gonzalez Rogers wrote. 

But she expressed concern that Apple was keeping consumers in the dark about alternative payment methods and ordered Apple to lift its ban on in-app links, buttons and messages to users about other ways to pay.

Apple has appealed the judge’s ruling, asking her to pause her orders while the appeals process plays out, which could take several years.

One of the speakers was Bill Gates and during the question and answer session, he was asked a question that had everyone laughing.

If he, the richest man in the world, could accept that his daughter marries a poor or modest man.

His answer can change something in everyone.

***Bill*** \- *First of all, understand that Wealth does not mean having a fat bank account.* ***Wealth is primarily the ability to create wealth.***

*Example: Someone who wins the lottery or gambling. Even if he wins 100 million is not a rich man: He is a poor man with a lot of money. That's the reason why 90% of the lottery millionaires become poor again after 5 years.*

*You also have rich people who have no money.*

*Example: Most entrepreneurs.*

*THEY are already on the road to wealth even though they have no money because they are developing their financial intelligence and that is wealth.*

*How are the rich and the poor different?*

*If you see a young person who decides to train, to learn new things, who tries to improve himself constantly, know that he is a rich man.*

*If you see a young person who thinks that the problem is the state, and who thinks that the rich are all thieves and who criticizes constantly, know that he is a poor man.*

*The rich are convinced that they just need information and training to take off, the poor thing that others must give them money to take off.*

*In conclusion, when I say that my daughter will not marry a poor man, I am not talking about money. I'm talking about the ability to create wealth in that man.*

*Excuse me for saying this, but most criminals are poor people. When they are in front of money, they lose their mind, that's why they rob, steal, etc... For them, it is grace because they don't know how they could earn money by themselves.*

*One day, the guard of a bank found a bag full of money, he took the bag and went to give it to the bank manager.*

*People called this man an idiot, but in reality, this man was just a rich man who had no money.*

*One year later, the bank offered him a job as a receptionist, 3 years later he was a customer manager and 10 years later he manages the regional management of this bank, he manages hundreds of employees and his annual bonus exceeds the amount he could have stolen.*

***Wealth is first of all a state of mind.****""*",1636137376.0

(From The Bitcoin Standard)

All the European countries resorted to unsound currency to finance World War I, an event of unprecedented destruction that accomplished almost nothing except setting the stage for World War II.  Far from being a ""barbarous relic,"" (as Lord Keynes described it) the gold standard was a necessary constraint on the state.  

&#x200B;

>With sound money, the government's war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect.  With unsound money, it is restrained by how much money it can create before the currency is destroyed.

That destruction of the currency can include hyperinflation, a phenomenon unique to government money backed by nothing.

* Which laws could decisively dismantle these monopolies and promote more competitors to join in?
* What incentive could be created to promote fair competition that could benefit us all?
* What could stop simulated shortages from oligarchs and create abundance in services and products?

Not exactly a fan of unregulated capitalism as I see the entire system as greedy and exploitive. Didn’t come here to antagonize y’all though, just wanted to exchange ideas.

With that said, I’m curious as to what you all think is an acceptable minimum wage? Not a number per se, but the quality of life that it’s meant to sustain. 

When FDR first introduced this, it was meant to actually be a *livable* wage - https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938. Of course this means you should be able to feed yourself and have a roof over your head at the very least without working 4 different jobs. 

It seems today that many believe that for example, the giant fast food corporations don’t need to pay workers sufficiently for their labor because it’s “not a real job” or “it’s for teens/high school students”. It seems to me that from a capitalist perspective, cutting corners when compensating your workers is just a means to maximize your profit, which is a core tenet of capitalism. (See: chattel slavery, child labor, sweatshops). I believe that if you can’t pay your employees a livable wage, *in most cases* you probably shouldn’t be in business.

For those unfamiliar, an unrealized gain is when you hold a financial asset (stock, crypto, options, etc.) that holds a positive value from when you purchased it. When you sell it, it becomes a realized gain, which is already taxed. An unrealized gain can quickly become an unrealized loss because financial assets are variable.

I hope you see how crazy this is. If you happen to be a billionaire then you have to pay a tax, even though you haven't made income and could potentially lose money if the stock declines in value. Furthermore, billionaires generally have most of their wealth in stocks, so it would be a huge tax on them. This would be especially  brutal for founders of companies, who had the stock when it was worth almost nothing. They would have to pay a massive tax on their unrealized gains!

Unlike us regular folks, billionaires don't have to live in the US to work in the US. Why wouldn't they just leave if such a egregious tax were levied? It's also a slippery slope. Once you do it to billionaires, couldn't you eventually push it to millionaires and then less? And if you want change, then why not just raise the capital gains tax on billionaires instead of proposing stupid ideas like this?

As this [source](https://beincrypto.com/treasury-secretary-tax-unrealized-crypto-gains/) puts it:

*Indeed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signaled the government was looking into taxing unrealized gains earlier this week and sent some crypto investors into a frenzy with one enthusiast insisting it proved the Biden administration was “willing to annihilate all investor sentiment in order to raise money to fund their reckless spending spree.”*",1635564102.0

Capitalism has many facets but one of them is to drive down price through competition - which is the part I'm talking about today.  Eventually, as long as there is a system that is in place to prevent and punish planed obsolescence, all prices go down to % fractions above cost.  This is because, in a healthy and fair market (which we don't have but that is a different story), productivity and efficiency increases over time.  Well long term, including automation of all things, we are literally talking about a 0 sum game by the end where capitalism wins by evolving itself into something else - what that is I have some hypothesis on (a new revolution in the public domain as well as traditional buying methods both together and combined).  What happens when we hit that point where we have invented the most affordable ways to live, cleared out all margins and middle men and the economic force drives towards 0 because of the unlimited supply (think how digital products have infinite supply but only in a physical reality through automation, 3d printing and so on).  If that isn't the goal, what is ultimately the goal?  Capitalism has great qualities, it's not perfect by far, but there is a point where it may become incompatible with how humans live long term (50-100 years from now).  If you were to select a long term goal for Capitalism, knowing how it works, what does that look like to you today?

One current example is the energy industry in the UK, really what's happening could quite easily have been predicted, these energy companies make a LOT of money. Currently the government are now talking about raising the energy price cap, a measure which was specifically introduced to protect consumers from unexpected price hikes. Why do they not have reserves put aside to weather the storm? 

It feels as if once you get to a certain size in our capitalist economies, you get to stop playing by the rules which effect every other small business.

I think anyone contributing this much time to a wealthy country should be able to afford standard necessities. Such necessities in my mind include a house, medical care, food, water, utilities. America is currently on the border of this, with many workers not being able to afford all the things above. The problem for America comes down to corporations opting to spend their profits each year on expansion, rather than employee pay. I'm not going to give my opinion on a solution, but to me, that seems to be the core of the problem. And if you think this isn't a problem, look around. It's not a few dozen workers, it's the whole country, throwing a fit. Psychology of the masses works on input/output, and if there's enough people lashing out, there's an underlying problem that needs addressing.

But, capitalism isn't a form of government. It's an economic policy, and I'm tired of the two being interchanged.

Capitalism works so well and is so fundamental, many people don't even realize what it is. If a country allows people to run their own business, it has a capitalism based monetary policy. Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Japan, S. Korea, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, America, Taiwan, Vietnam, South Africa, China, Russia. All capitalist.

In the U.S., one of the possible avenues for legally handling child abuse is for Child Protective Services to (in theory) intervene on the abuse and separate the child from the family until the situation is resolved. Of course, CPS in practice is far different and a mess of ethics and rights, but that's irrelevant to the question.
Let's say, in Ancapistan, there is a married couple physically abusing their child or children. Children can't consent to contracts and are in many ways incapacitated in their capacity to deal with this type of situation, so how does it get resolved? If the community/public finds out, do they intervene?
I've tried to think about this myself but I have not come to any useful conclusions. Abuse and intervention is an ethical landmine in every sense of the phrase.",1630627092.0

The family didn't want their children fighting ""wars they didn't care about."" 

Volker became a successful businessman in Kansas City and was extremely generous with his wealth. He even became a voluntary taxpayer when he started the country's first welfare program in Kansas City. He later changed his mind on this idea when the Tom Pendergast political machine co-opted the program for their own purposes. He decided that private charity and free markets were the best way to support the poor. 

Towards the end of his life, he established ""The Volker Fund,"" which would go on to launch free-market scholarship during a time when these ideas were very unpopular in the U.S. He died ""middle class"" since he had already given away his wealth. The fund would go on to pay the salaries of Mises, Rothbard, & Hayek after his death in 1947.

Apple has rules that force app developers to collect payments through the App Store's subscription system, taking 30% of revenue along the way.

I understand that in a free-market society, they're free to do whatever they want since it's their platform, and developers can stop publishing there if they don't like the rules.  
But that means not serving (around) half the people in the world.

&#x200B;

This is an artwork I created in 2011 titled ""Bastiat Mask,"" inspired by the writings of the economic historian and social critic Frederic Bastiat, considered to be one of the great proto-Austrians.

&#x200B;

**Medium:**

framed digital inkjet print, newsprint paper, laserprint on copy paper, pencil, uncredited appropriated internet imagery, glue, photography, composited in Photoshop

&#x200B;

**Statement:**

“Bastiat Mask” is a likeness of the 19th-century French economic journalist Frederic Bastiat, manifest as a hastily fashioned, two-dimensional mask. It is the type of mask that can be held to one’s face, as in a masquerade ball, by the wooden stick that appears stapled to its bottom.

Curiously, rather than having two eye holes set in their traditional locations, Bastiat Mask features only one, cut into the middle of the forehead, the “third eye” position. It is the artist’s fantasy that, should one look through this supernatural eye hole as they adorn their faces with the mask, they would be able to see what Bastiat saw through his own mind’s eye. They would become privy to a worldview that renders the once-murky understanding of money and commerce instantly clear, their fractured thoughts about the nature of an economy mended, and erroneous notions about *laissez-faire* banished.

It is Bastiat’s mystical “third eye” that is singularly equipped to grant access to his vision precisely because it was an enlightened one, a vision that seemed to transcend the boundaries of mere mortal thought, even as it expanded them. In order to speak to one of the facets of a truly capitalist society, to honor private property (its keystone), whilst flaunting disdain for monopolistic “intellectual property” and the destructive statutory jungle it has spawned, the artist incorporates uncredited imagery, appropriated from the internet.",1559351907.0

"I really think AnCap should be called ""Market Anarchism.""",Conservative,7,b59pen,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/b59pen/i_really_think_ancap_should_be_called_market/,13,"**TL:DR The 'capitalism' of today is the 'mercantilism' of yesterday... and [mercantilism](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&ei=dtOYXKviOPLR0PEP3ume0Aw&q=define+mercantism&oq=define+mercantism&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i10l8j0i22i30l2.5157.5699..5747...0.0..0.81.229.3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0.OUaHxQOdGBY) is not anarchist.**

It's less of an oxymoron. I know the capitalists in here are going to disagree, and the AnComs are probably laughing, but let me explain. 

The fundamental beliefs of AnCap can be summarised with the NAP and voluntarism. NAP is the non-aggression principle, for any outsiders. Honestly, I can't see how anyone can have a problem with the NAP, so I'm not going to get into this. Voluntarism, on the other hand, is the voluntary actions among people resulting in self-government and a free-market.

The reason I think we should be rebranded as ""market anarchists"" is because it actually makes more sense from the conventional anarchist's perspective. In fact, our ideology makes much more sense under this name since ""capitalism"" carries a very systemic implication and I do agree it doesn't feel very anarchistic. What non-AnCaps call ""capitalism"" is what ""corporate capitalism"" is to us and as I shitposted about before, it's the system we're currently in. Where the state systemically promotes ""capitalism"" through corporatisation, which protects your personal assets. This takes a lot of the risk out of business, since if Facebook belly-flopped tomorrow, Mr. Zucc would still be a member of high society. Facebook also isn't likely to belly-flop tomorrow though. See how this sounds a lot like mercantilism?

Basically, I'm saying ""capitalism"" is when the government is in the market, therefore, it's no longer free. If it isn't free of the state, then it isn't anarchist. Why do think libertarians love to ramble about getting government ""out of the market?"" [While by literal definition of ""capitalism"" is not a dirty word,](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=define+capitalism) I'm not going to deny that the word has been bastardised into it's modern crony counterpart. Why do you think corporations are called ""publicly traded companies?"" It's because they're 'public,' in other words, state mandated. (Public schools... Public library... public bus...) Corporations are a result of *laws,* which will let companies act as single entities and protect personal assets. Therefore, corporations are not a result of the market, but of the state. On top of that, it's a form of protectionism for wealth which is something seen in mercantilism, which **is not anarchist.** When the CEO of a corporation makes a dumb corporate decision, **his corporation gets sued. Not him.** Do you understand now? He can face no legal repercussions for what he does as ""Corporation Inc."" The employees usually sign a document which gives up some of that protection. Again, we live under *mercantilism,* where government enacts protectionism. 

Which led me into reading about Anarcho-Mutualism. While I don't see myself as an AnMutualist, it's good to note that Proudhon himself was not against the free-market. He was against systemic capitalism. AnComs at the time even went so far as to distinguish themselves from him because of this, since they saw any market as a form of oppression against the will of the people. Proudhon did not, as you can read in the ""criticisms"" section of the Mutualism Wikipedia page. Proudhon actually seemed to support the market and one AnCom went so far as to call him an ""individualist"" as opposed to a ""collectivist"" like an AnCom is, but he probably also didn't really believe in private property which is where I draw my grey area. As many will happily point out, there's little distinction between ""private"" and ""personal"" property. It's also strange to me that paying rent voluntarily is considered a form of exploitation. It's... voluntary. Conditional does not mean forced. You could also buy property instead. I see where the argument comes from, I just don't see how we could reasonably apply that to the real world as discerning between ""private"" and ""personal"" property becomes more of a grey area the more you question it. Is letting someone use your personal property in exchange for use out of their personal property exploitation? That's an exchange of goods and services. It's a market! ... **But it is not capitalism.**

So that leads me to my conclusion, where we should be rebranded as ""market anarchists."" We believe in voluntarism, the free-market, and the non-aggression principle. Sounds a bit better doesn't it? We're distinguishable from anarcho-mutualists in the fact that we see no distinction between ""personal"" and ""private"" property, but we aren't capitalists because we believe in a market without interference from the state and we believe that individuals can govern themselves through the NAP, the market, and arbitration. That sounds much more anarchist to me. The free-market is at the centre of our ideology, hence the name. I like to think that most anarchists aren't against the NAP or voluntarism, as you'd pretty much be against consent and you would believe in rule of force/aggression at that point. It's also good to note that the NAP is not a law. It's a right governed by the will of the people and their interpretation of the non-aggression principle. Enforcement is enacted through individual disputes in arbitration and violence is only allowed against a violent aggressor. Keep in mind that it's down to **the people's interpretation** of ""violent aggressor."" That idiot who yelled ""FIRE"" in a crowded building? You really think the arbiters and jury will say that didn't break the NAP? Probably not. Everyone could easily argue disturbing the peace is a form of aggression and it would be appropriate for that situation. Laws aren't always appropriate for every situation, this is why [judicial nullification](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=define+judicial+nullification) exists, and this system has that pro over it. In fact, some people equate judicial nullification to anarchy, since it puts the will of the people above the law, therefore, placing the people above the state. **This is literally about as anarchist as a judicial system can get.**

EDIT: Here's the link to the Wikipedia page. Formatting, the parentheses at the end, is preventing me from linking it with text. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory) Ironically, I actually think AnCaps should give AnMutualists a little bit more respect and vice-versa. I find the two to be more related than most think, especially Proudhon. The ""capitalism"" in AnCap obviously scares a lot of them off and as I pointed out, AnCaps have no problem with private property whereas AnMutualists try to make that distinction between ""private"" and ""personal"" property. In fact, it was Proudhon's book *What is Property?* that convinced the young Marx that private property should be abolished. Proudhon criticised it; Marx wanted to abolish it. There's a difference and that is the difference that distinguishes communists from mutualists. Marx actually heavily criticised Proudhon, which is a bit weird considering how buddy-buddy AnMutualists have gotten with AnComs.

> In their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution: ""I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction"".

**Proudhon was not a communist,** and he's an anarchist to me even though I don't consider myself AnMutualist.

> As a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected **both capitalism and communism.** He adopted the term mutualism for his brand of anarchism, which involved control of the means of production by the workers.

Consider China, or the US. Compared to ancap philosophy, they both have low personal freedoms and high taxes. They can use these taxes to fund extremely strong militaries.

#Disengage Left Virtue Signaling Devices


When learning logic, teachers warn repeatedly that once you learn how to spot bad logic you'll see it everywhere. 

That's a huge understatement in USA. 

It's much more to the point to warn logic students that they live in a society of child-like adults, and once you get one stage above conventional in logical reasoning, you'll never look at the concept of 'adults' in the same way ever again. 

It much more to reality to understand there are no adult in neoliberal USA.  

-------

&nbsp; 

Left activism is the worst example of an entire section of society run completely by adolescent mentality. 

Every issue, every identity, every subculture, every left publication, every respected academic and every part within the entire entity is run like a high-school glee-club. 

That didn't work to secure any justice for the working-class...but Leftist seem to have had fun the whole time. That's American adults. Anything they do to have fun is wonderful. That's the child-like attitude of all US adults, and left activism is not only included in that, but the most significant example of the societal problem. 

A metaphor for these words is pissing in the wind, because I think any leftist cares about progress. Leftist only care about making sure everyone knows they are good people since they make sure to stay angry about things they have no idea how to handle. Leftist only seek respect for their anger, and ideas are not needed. Just a 40 year virtue signaling narrative. 

The good leftists didn't do shit for the suffering working-class.

-------

&nbsp; 

It took about 30 years to figure-out that leftist were full of shit and didn't believe in peace or justice but do believe in being angry and yelling. 

Leftists haven't accomplished anything but regression in 30 years, but every 17 old leftist believes themselves to be a political mastermind. 

All the left is now is juvenile mayhem. It's a fantasy world now. 

Their activism hasn't worked and keeps getting more and more irrelevant, but no leftist will move an inch from their folk-mysticism that passes for 'justice activism'. 

-------

&nbsp; 

I understand because I watched the evolution for decades myself. 

Americans want hedonism like Stage 1 of moral development. Americans want to stay children, and are insulted if you ask them to think of explain their thought processes. 

Left activism is front and center in the mix. 

Activism wants hedonism and opportunism, yet still asks for justice. 

It did that for 50 years. Morality was poo-pooed as silly, and still is. 

#Doesn't believe morality exists ---- still asks people to be moral

Leftist activism has no new ideas, doesn't accept any sort of thinking that is not what they've done for 50 years, and so has nothing but stagnation, regression and irrelevance in its future. 

Leftist already have and have given the people all the justice they're ever going to see. 


-------

&nbsp; 

The left can't mature because it doesn't want-to. Every one under neoliberalism demands to stay children for life, and leftist don't want to be left out of the American dream. 

It's boring to watch the thing screaming and only digging itself into a deeper. 

There's not a difference between Left activism and the morals of the ruling-class. Both tell you justice is not possible, but the psychotic leftists scream that it is possible at the same time. 

That's all you'll for your entire lifetime. You have decades of watching that dysfunctional and fraudulent justice movement. 

American is all bullshit. From the top to the bottom, it's one hedonistic juvenile culture.

>Let me ask you this and answer honestly: You have $500. You can spend it on hiring the kid next door to mow your lawn for $20 for a third of the year, or you can mow your own lawn spend it on a new game console. Which would you choose?

>We'll use the same scenario to answer your question about how the 1% enforces their wealth. Say you choose to hire the kid next door. You agree he will mow your lawn for a third of the year. He say he needs it to fund his dog's operation. He mows your lawn, and you pay him $20. You then decide you'd rather have a new console and can mow your lawn yourself. You can choose from multiple options: [1] you can nullify the agreement and be the neighborhood jerk, [2] you can tell him you'll lower down his pay to $10, [3] you can tell him you'll give him the $20 but he has to buy the gas for the mower himself from that $20, or [4] you can tell him to fuck off your lawn or you'll shoot him and gis dog with your shotgun.

My reply:

>If you have limited funds and you're set on reducing your lawn service costs, there are a few other options you missed. You can't present a complex set of solutions without covering all of them!

>* You can go to his competitor and offer $15 or however little amount he is willing to take. 
* Another option is you let your grass grow and just don't cut it, this is the cheapest route immediately since you don't even need gas or a mower for it, but could have long term costs. 
* You could salt/herbacide the yard and nothing would grow there, this would cost less than $20 and only have to be done once.
* You could let the grass grow and then try to light it on fire, probably not a good idea, but it's one way to handle it.
* You could start a service where you take care of people's goats and allow the goats to eat the grass. Thus earning yourself additional profit and solving the grass problem.
* You could let the grass grow full length and then cut it into hay, bail it, and then sell it for a profit. You could even pay the kid next door to do all this and break even without having to exert yourself much at all. This way you keep your existing money, the kid next door earns money, and someone gets hay for their animals or whatever.

>**Thank you for emphasizing a very important point. You only presented 4 options. And that is very much what the free market is like under government regulation. My solutions wouldn't have even been possible despite me coming up with a much better solution as my answer than if I had followed the government's rules and chose 1 of the 4.**

>The last option would probably be my answer based on a lot of assumptions I'm making about the problem, but it's very hard to say without knowing all of the circumstances.

The more popular it becomes, the less popular common sense against their arguments and proposals become. Most of these communists haven't read or comprehended any of this socialist crap, or know the history of it. Those that do are doing their best to muddy the waters with lies and accusations of lies on the part of people who uncover the atrocities caused by socialist regimes.

Whether we like it or not, socialism is on the rise in the developed world. The opposition to socialism and economic literacy are also on the rise, but that isn't going to lower the risk of socialist sabotage of general freedoms, whether that sabotage is purposeful or not.

As far as truth goes, this isn't an equal battle. The truth is heavily stacked in our favor. Being able to communicate that fact without bias towards our beliefs is what will show that the truth is on our side. As of right now, superior argumentation and the mainstreaming of the arguments against socialism is the best way to get the average Joe to understand the dangers of it.

Become a professional in communist literature and talking points and the arguments against them, for the sake of the millions who have died under these regimes. Explaining basic economics only goes so far to people who won't listen or don't care. Learn their methods and the dishonesty and fallacies of their arguments, and let it be known to people who haven't been indoctrinated yet.

By the way, thanks to all of you who helped me out with the basics of Anarcho-capitalism!

How will health care work, given the inflation on the free market due to write-offs from the hospital? Hospitals everyday take in whoever they see sick in their emergency rooms. It is my understanding that if you are having a heart attack, they will treat you first, and ask about your insurance later. 

So, when a person comes in who is having a heart attack, has no insurance, and no job, he gets treated for his heart attack and lives to tell about it. He leaves the hospital with a $100,000 bill that he never intends on paying, and the hospital eventually realizes this. They write it off, because they know they can try to send him to collections, but more than likely, that money will never be seen.

How do you have a free market, where this sort of thing is bound to happen. The hospitals inevitably shift the loss of profit to insurance holding patients, thus rising the cost of medical care overall. How do we fix this problem? ",1521128191.0

So in a free society, I still do not understand how the first group of people, something like a caricature of a peasant, can even exist without destroying that society and the liberty enjoyed by others, who make totally different decisions.

But the mere existence of that tension/demand/incentive raises ethical and rational questions for me concerning the logical underpinning of anarchocapitalism.  

I can get all wordy with it but over the years arguing with my Ancap friends I have reduced it to a pretty basic scenario/question so here goes-

if you are born into a stateless society and have no land, then you are necessarily reduced to organizing your entire life around gratifying the interests of those who do.  And there is little incentive for them to permit the elevation of your station.  So, why is it not coercion to tell a newborn baby, ""Oh you want water? Get a job.""


*my working out of this conundrum has since caused me to abandon the moral and logical precepts of AC'ism in search of an idea that respects the property of our species' cognitive hardware that recognizes rather instinctively the injustice of dooming babies to servitude and barring their access to territorial resources for their sustenance.

Need moral advice from AnCap perspective re: a friend's land deal,Conservative,7,60gom3,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/60gom3/need_moral_advice_from_ancap_perspective_re_a/,60,"A friend and i had a falling out over how he handled a land deal that turned sour and I want to know if you all think I did the right thing.

Both of us have been AnCaps since high school though I haven't always been into the philosophy of it as much as he is. He left town after high school and basically got rich in Silicon Valley doing db administration.

The trouble started last year when my friend bought some land in town he wanted to build a summer home on. The previous owner had a house on it that burned down and he stopped paying taxes on it (or something like that. I don't know the details) so it got repossessed by the city. My friend bought it from the city and started drawing up plans to build on it. I was going to help oversee the project while he was away (since I live right down the block and used to do construction work).

A couple months after he bought it we were surveying the property and we found a squatter. He had built a little lean to and had planted some potatoes and corn. We told him he had to leave but the squatter wouldn't budge. Things got pretty heated and my friend basically threatened to call the cops if the guy didn't leave by the time they started work tearing down the old foundation.

Threatening government force doesn't sit right with me although I guess if we're forced to pay for it we might as well use it when we're in the right. But anyways, I decided to try to reason with the squatter a couple days later. I explained the situation to him and why my friend had a right to the land but the squatter wasn't having it. The squatter says the government had no right to take the land from the previous owner and that my friend basically paid for stolen goods so he doesn't have a rightful claim. The squatter says he's got a better claim than anyone since he homesteaded it after it was abandoned by the previous owner. He wants my friend to buy the property off him.

My friend was upset that I even suggested buying off the squatter. He says the squatter knew he was breaking the law when he started squatting so he deserves what's coming to him and that since he owns the land the squatter is violating the non aggression principle. I'm not so sure about that because I don't see why it's my friend's property at all. Really, you could say we're violating the squatters rights by threatening to send jack booted thugs against him. 

Long story short, I told my friend I wouldn't help oversee the project unless he bought the land off the squatter fair and square. Now he's not talking to me and I assume he's going to send jackbooted government thugs over there soon. Did I do the right thing?",1490018868.0

I view history as a series of civilizations with increased levels of centralized power: tribes -> duchies- > nation states. I see these forming from claims to land, protected by private armies, which are made possible only through the wealth of a person/group of people who fund the armies. Resources extracted from the claimed land further empower the central authority, be it a chieftain, a royal family, or a federal government. Wealth equates to power, as greater wealth allows one to acquire more goods and services. 

Capital begets capital, something we see happening today and something that was apparent in Pinochet's Chile, arguably the most free-market-friendly government of the 20th century. And it's undeniable that the wealthiest Americans exercise enormous power over our political system by financing campaigns. In an ancap society, what are the checks on the power that capital gives? What is to stop the wealthiest from hiring their own private armies and staking territorial claims? Were prehistoric societies not ancap societies, which ultimately led to increasingly large centralized authorities?

Who are the REAL Corporate shills?,Conservative,5,4ifphb,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/4ifphb/who_are_the_real_corporate_shills/,5,"The real corporate shills aren't libertarians and ancaps, but the anti-corporatist liberals and leftists.  They are the *perfect* shills, because they have no idea that their efforts against corporations is just making the corps stronger and more powerful.  

Corporations were created by governments.  Corporations have special privileges and protections from governments.  ""Crony Capitalism"" (Crapitalism!) is all about government doing things on behalf of the corporations, corporate welfare, and legislation to protect corporations from competition.  

The anti-corporatists, while strangely recognizing that corporations influence, subvert, and control government, somehow think that the solution is to give the government MORE power over society, and then government will SOMEHOW be able to resist the influence and subversion by corporations, and thus allow government to control corporations.  Because being able to vote somehow makes government accountable to ""the people"".  Not that that's provided much accountability up to this point.  But it will somehow work better in the future. 

In fact, giving the government more power merely means giving the corporations more power over government, and makes their influence and subversion even more powerful over the rest of society.  

See?  Perfect shills!

There are some few corporations that support libertarianism (cough, Koch Brothers, cough), but the great majority of corporations do NOT support libertarianism.  More importantly, NO corporation, not even the Koch Brothers, really favor the end of government and the creation of an anarchist society.  And for good reason. 

Corporations are dependent upon government for the vast powers they exercise.  Without government privileges and protections, and without the governmental power structure, Corporations have little choice other than to compete for consumers on an equal footing with other businesses.  The large corporate structure and bureaucracy becomes a hindrance without government protectionism.  Corporations would not only NOT become all-powerful in a market anarchist society, it's possible that they may not even be able to exist!

And then there are people who are so confused that they think that corporations using government for their corporate agenda is somehow equivalent to anarcho-capitalism and radical free marketeering.  Not only are they perfect corporate shills, but they don't even realize how they're undermining their own argument for more government controls and regulations!",1462732282.0
Black Market = Free Market?,Conservative,9,4ifdqr,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/4ifdqr/black_market_free_market/,3,"It seems to me that while a black market may be better than no market, it is clearly not a free market.  But perhaps this point is not so obvious to other people, so I thought it might make a good discussion.  

Suppliers on the black market are clearly trying to support a consumer demand for their product, so there are certainly some market incentives involved.  But as a black market operates illegally under the current regime, this prevents the full range of economic incentives that would exist in an actual free market.  It also prevents legal recourse against black marketeers, both suppliers and consumers.  Criminal activity by black marketeers is thus ""protected"" from legal actions by other black market participants.  Sometimes this leads to reasonable, self-policing, private arbitration efforts, but it also leads to a greater tendency for violent confrontation and retaliation.  

In short, the illegality of the black market exacerbates violent criminal tendencies, thus preventing the full range of economic incentives a free market would provide.

I've never been good at explaining things. I always understand it thoroughly, but when it comes out of my mouth, it sounds terrible.

A little backstory

I was with my girl and her parents, and we were talking about my girl's brother. Her brother doesn't think there should be police. I added my two cents by saying something along the lines of, ""I don't think there should be government owned police considering the government as a whole is rather corruptible. Instead I think there should be privatized security.""

Immediately her step-father started saying how without police, it would pretty much just be the purge. Then he started saying how private companies owning police would result is the poor not getting any protection.

Her mom agreed with me, and understood what I meant and they started arguing. I had no idea what to say after that without repeating what I had already stated prior.

How exactly would I go about explaining private sector security?",1457998717.0

About negligence and prevention,Conservative,1,49646b,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/49646b/about_negligence_and_prevention/,3,"Take this example given by Rothbard:

>Suppose, for example, that A builds a building, sells it to B, and it promptly collapses. A should be liable for injuring B's person and property and the liability should be proven in court, which can then enforce the proper measures of restitution and punishment. But if the legislature has imposed building codes and inspections in the name of ""safety,"" innocent builders (that is, those whose buildings have not collapsed) are subjected to unnecessary and often costly rules, with no necessity by government to prove crime or damage. They have committed no tort or crime, but are subject to rules, often only distantly related to safety, in advance by tyrannical governmental bodies. Yet, a builder who meets administrative inspection and safety codes and then has a building of his collapse, is often let off the hook by the courts. After all, has he not obeyed all the safety rules of the government, and hasn't he thereby received the advance imprimatur of the authorities?

Although the concept intuitively makes sense, it doesn't seem to hold when you consider others who are put at risk by negligence. For instance, B might have willingly and knowingly accepted to live in A's irresponsibly built building, however the building might collapse in C's house. Of course a building may collapse even with safety regulations in place, and the cause must be determined and proper action taken. It is also clear that the building might stay intact even with no regulations in place. Nevertheless, it is far more likely to collapse when regulations are violated, and given enough negligence it is bound to happen. What's to protect C from A's aggression if no measures are taken to prevent it? Isn't the negligence in itself an aggression? ",1457243243.0

It makes sense to me that in the short-term the price would reflect the subjective value placed on it, but in the long-run (in a perfectly competitive market) the price would only reflect the marginal cost.

Say a consumer values a banana at 10 utils. He goes to the market and finds only one banana vendor, selling them for 8 utils. Let's say the cost of producing a banana is 1 util. In the short-term the vendor can price disciriminate and maximize profits, but in the long-term more firms are attracted to the profit-rich market. Unless the firms collude (and assuming they sell an identical product), wouldn't there be a race to the bottom to out-compete the competition, with the market price ultimately falling until it hits marginal cost at which point no firm could go lower and still make a profit?

They attack the unprepared in places they think themselves safe.  They shoot and bomb the places where the innocent body count will be highest.

Terrorism is not war, and war is not terrorism.  War requires the courage to face armed adversaries, fully prepared for the reality of being shot and killed for your beliefs.  Terrorism cannot be answered by the state, even retribution is impossible, because the perpetrators of terrorist acts almost never survive, and do not value life even if they did.

The **ONLY** thing that would make this whole mess less tragic is if it could somehow be undone - to lower the body count of the innocent.  The past can't be changed, but these events aren't done unfolding.  There will be more of them.

No policy will unwind the hate from the vile fundamentalist mind, nor stop them from arming themselves and finding their way into your local shopping mall, your kids' schools, your coffee shops, your churches and synagogues .  Policy can't do fuck-all about them, and neither can police.  These acts are calculated to happen in the places where people feel the most safe, where they are not on their guard, where the first responders will *always* be too late to prevent an urgent hardship from becoming a tragedy.  **That is the very point.**

Calling this ""an act of war"" is a feeble abstraction that makes it sound like there's some front to which we can march an army, away from the place where we can leave our precious and delicate loved ones safely behind, in homes that the enemy would never be able to reach.  But there is not.  The enemy defines the front, and that front is *where you least expect it.*

The version of the events in France which, while still awful, is nevertheless *distinguishably superior* to the savage tragedy we've all just witnessed, is the version where the well armed citizens of Paris shoot back at these vicious animals and put them down on the spot.  Guns in the hands of the ethical.

Gun control, and the cultivated culture of abnegating responsibility for personal security onto the police, the state, and anyone else is as much to blame for the scale of this awful catastrophe as the savage, regressive, hateful, inhuman shit-soup of Muhammed's chosen assholes.

So stop calling this an act of war.  The state is powerless to oppose it.  We must all act as the white blood cells of society to root out the infection of ideological violence.

FROM THE MAKER OF 'STATISM: THE MOST DANGEROUS RELIGION',Conservative,7,3sgxun,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/3sgxun/from_the_maker_of_statism_the_most_dangerous/,0,"As a follow up/sequel (of sorts) to 'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6uVV2Dcqt0), I am currently working on a documentary length (60-90 minutes long) production with a working title of 'Voluntaryism: An Idea Whose Time Has Come' (although I am also considering the title 'Liberty Rising: The Philosophy of Anarcho-Capitalism'.

The film will be aimed at people who are either completely new to the philosophy of voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism, or who are half way to becoming voluntaryists/anarcho-capitalists (i.e. current minarchists), and it will guide the viewer through the philosophical groundwork of voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism, from the non-aggression principle, self ownership and the philosophical basis for property rights, to the fundamental economics and benefits of the free market (from an Austrian School perspective), the coercive nature of statism (and taxation), debunking all the most common philosophical justifications for the alleged legitimacy of the state (social contract theory, democratic consensus arguments, utilitarian/consequentialist arguments, et cetera) and, finally, it will address anarcho-capitalist alternatives to the ""services"" currently provided in a coercive, monopolistic, extortionate manner by the state.

The film will be made available for free on YouTube, although I am also planning to release it on DVD (at low cost), which people will be free to copy and distribute as much as they like to friends, family and total strangers.

I will be using plenty of narrated excerpts from both 'For a New Liberty' and 'The Ethics of Liberty' by Murray Rothbard, and I am hoping to also feature relevant snippets from talks/interviews by the likes of Stefan Molyneux, Tom Woods, Walter Block, Mike Huemer, Larken Rose, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, David Friedman, Robert Murphy, Lew Rockwell and others (providing I can get permission from all those people, and the relevant copyright owners). 

The whole video montage will be compiled in such a way that each segment flows coherently into the next, and all of it will be ""glued"" together with narration written by myself but actually voiced by a paid narrator (I hate the sound of my own voice).

I have already been working on this project for over a year now, and I have made a lot of headway, but due to work constraints, I have been unable to work on it anywhere near as much as I would like (ideally I'd be working on it full time), and there's still a fair amount of work to do. In a desperate bid to finally get this project finished and released, I am reluctantly asking for assistance.

The film features an abundance of nifty motion graphics, animation and stock footage (all designed or paid for by myself, except for any free/public domain stock footage I've been able to find) to help visually illustrate the points made in the video. As anybody involved in motion graphic design or animation will know, these endeavours can be extremely time consuming. If anybody reading this is skilled in graphic design, motion graphic design, animation, narration, or any other relevant areas, and is interested in helping with the project, please get in touch at 'johnnada80@googlemail.com'. I will obviously credit anybody who helps in any way in the closing titles.

In addition to assistance with the technical side of things, in the coming weeks I will be starting a kickstarter campaign, accompanied by a trailer to give people an idea of the production quality, style and content of the film. Basically, in order to finish the film, I need funding, to pay for things like stock footage (which really isn't cheap), a narrator, studio headphones/monitors, a computer capable of rendering complicated, high definition motion graphics (without taking two days!), a decent studio microphone and a website to promote the film (including website development, web hosting and domain name).

I would never usually ask for funding. I worked on 'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' for three months straight, pretty much full time, with many sleepless nights and 48 hour editing marathons, but that is only 12 minutes long, and the new film will be 4-6 times longer than that, so I'm going to need help if this thing is going to get finished anytime soon!

'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' has now been translated into over 12 languages (the last time I checked), and has already had over 300,000 views (including the translated versions and reuploads). In my humble opinion, the new film is significantly better, more persuasive and aesthetically pleasing, so it has the potential to blow my previous effort out of the water and really make a huge impact in getting the ideas of liberty (specifically voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism) spread around the world!

Well that's the end of my rant/begging. Watch this space for the trailer which will be released in the coming weeks/months, and please consider helping out with the kickstarter campaign which I will be starting soon!

If anybody would like to contribute via Bitcoin prior to the release of the trailer/kickstarter campaign, the address is: 1JfweLVprPCnUmRKpqC9uK7NZbZjt9XazW

"What developments in attitude are necessary for a ""stabilized"" anarchy?",Conservative,1,3fee43,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/3fee43/what_developments_in_attitude_are_necessary_for_a/,3,"I believe that anarchistic societies to be the highest ideal to strive for. A plurality of self-sustaining anarchist collectives. However I am burdened by trying to understand why these profit seeking collectives wouldn't join forces to protect their interests and thus lead us back into centralized government.

What changes in attitude or changes to the world at large are necessary to bring about a stabilized anarchy?

Well the good news is that global government mismanagement combined with technological advances is causing a power struggle. If change continues to advance more rapidly than human bureaucracy can cope with, then small groups of people who understand and can utilize those technologies will be freed from the bureaucracy. As technology advances and branches out we may see governments become more or less obsolete. 

However, I'm not certain this will be a good thing for the majority of the slave class. Those who stay on the cutting edge of the new technologies (automation) will be employed by corporations, while those who have no skills to offer these corporations will find they have nowhere to turn to.

When I meander down these thought-paths I always come back to the same conclusion. We humans have multiple problems, but the principle problems are that most communities around the world have outsourced many of their essential needs production (food and water), and we have too many people on this planet.

Because most communities are dependent upon other communities for food and water, changes that affect availability or prices of those commodities must move in lockstep globally or people face starvation or dehydration. We have so many people that disruptions in these markets often cause human suffering.

What exactly is the incentive for managing this complex network of food and water for 7billion people when the corporations running everything only need less than 1billion to create an indefinitely self-sustaining peak civilization?

I'm not saying that it is impossible for the Earth to support 7billion people (though some do make that argument) but that human populations grew faster than our ability to sustainably support our level of population and growth. 

I do see the dissolution of ""modern"" government in the near (10-20years) future, but I'm concerned it will just be replaced with corporate government rather than a plurality of bottom-up societies.",1438430369.0

A Hypothetical,Conservative,0,3903hh,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/3903hh/a_hypothetical/,9,"Let's say you're in a libertarian utopia, and you buy some large tracts of land. You don't want anybody violating this property of yours, and decide to shoot trespassers on sight. This must be respected, nobody can infringe upon your freedom to say what goes on in your own damn property, no faggot government or nothin. But it seems that your lands stretch over a dirt road that you overlooked, and is used by the locals to get here and there casually. This doesn't stand with you, so you hire the pinkertons. They capture anyone crossing through your land and kill them. Now, since you are an enterprising person, you seek access to the ocean, and you work out a deal with a corporation wherein you buy some land which borders the sea. It turns out there are quite a few people living there, and you decide it would be unprofitable to try to purge them all together. But since they won't leave your property when you request them to, and they are not allowed to be there, you decide they might as well be put to good use. You send the pinkertons to force them into fishing and working in mines, all with quotas they must fulfill. You profit greatly from this, and buy more land. There are people living here too. You follow the same procedure, and after years pass you have millions of people under your freedom of jurisdiction and right to determine what goes on in your property. Sometimes they get rowdy and rebellious, so you decide it would be good for small children to be separated from their families and put into facilities that you had erected, and in these facilities they would be shown advertisements for your company, particularly advertisements that glorify you as a god and romanticize working for your company and promise good lives if work is done well. They would attend these facilities for about 6 hours a day. But then back to work. Your get old and die, and your son inherits your property. By this time a unique and homogeneous culture has developed thanks to your education facilities conditioning the minds of the young. Your son is widely celebrated among the people, and he feels they can be trusted to be hired as militia, to accompany the pinkertons, who had been getting very old lately. Your son wishes to expand the property even further. Luckily, the company with bordering land was not doing so well- the inhabitants of those lands had overthrown the owners, and of course this was immoral and illegal! Your son feels it is justified to restore order to the land, by force if necessary. So he mobilizes the people of his property, gives them weapons, and sends them off to battle against the neighboring savages. The result is a victory for your son, and so he annexes the lands. The army was happy to fight for their homelend and king (er, CEO). The assimilation process begins, with more facilities being developed in the new lands. Another generation passes, and the kingdom (er, property) is passed down to your grandson, and by this time the inhabitants of the new lands had mostly been assimilated. Unfortunately, the company which had formerly claimed those lands was upset over your company's holding of them, and they were ready to fight your grandson about it. They had also amassed an army over time, and so the war began. The battles stretched for 10 years, with no clear victor in sight. The people of your grandson's property began to become angry, and there was not enough money to be spent on schooling and assimilation, because the GDP had to be totally spent on the war effort, and so the people became increasingly militant and rebellious. Eventually your grandson was usurped by the youngest son of a wealthy family from within the property, who promised the people a better life and an end to wars. This man worked out a peace deal with the other corporation- they would get the lands back. The man's dynasty ruled fairly for a few generations, but skirmishes became more frequent with neighboring landowners once more. Some wars would be won, some would be lost; and eventually rule became more corrupt and exploitative, and the people once again became upset, until there was yet another usurping. This pattern would continue for a thousand years, and the situation for all other lands in the area was the same. 

Would you like living in the libertarian utopia?

Defensive Wars in an Ancap Society,Conservative,1,37uytc,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/37uytc/defensive_wars_in_an_ancap_society/,5,"Assume the US decides today to privatize all functions of government, and Canada decides tomorrow to invade the US, forcing all the Canadian citizens into conscription and taxing them at a 93% rate.

On the question of how the anarchist society would defend itself against the Canadians, several issues come to mind:

1. Coordination problems. There may be thousands or tens-of-thousands of private defense corporations, but these firms get paid by their customers to defend only their customers. How do all the defense firms band together to coordinate the war effort, especially given that one defense firm doesn't want to defend another defense firm's customers? Isn't it more efficient to force them under the command of one man, force them to share information, and etc.? Say these Canadians start attacking at Niagara Falls in order to conquer New York. Why would the Californian defense firms give a shit about the New York customers?


2. Freeloader problems. I think we can assume the defensive war effort will cost more than what I am already paying to my private law enforcement agency. If my firm increases its prices, but the next firm does not, and I don't think the Canadians have it in them to win, what is preventing me from switching firms to the cheaper one and leaching off everyone else who pays the increase fees?


3. Additionally, it's commonly stated among ancaps that nuclear weapons would not be developed in our society as no profit monger could justify the expense, of which only a State war monger could because of revenues from taxation at the point of a gun. However, what about Canada? They decide to invade, they have increased the tax rate of their citizens at the point of a gun, and they have developed nuclear capabilities. Don't we need at the least some Iron Dome type system to stop nuclear bombs coming from Canada? Isn't this extremely expensive - i.e., requiring a State with Force? Even when a few defense firms create iron domes, the coordination and freeloader problem arises. Why should I pay any of them when I believe other people will pay for ""my share""? And, God-forbid I mention it, wouldn't a nuclear deterrent also be useful in this situation of preventing another non-ancap nation from attacking us?


4. Bribery. Canada has a gun to the head of its citizens and is forcing them to pay a 93% tax rate, generating a substantial sum of money. What is to prevent Canada from successfully bribing the defense firms to either stay out of the fight or even join Canada? Or bribing them for information on other defense firms that they are coordinating with? With a State, the death penalty for traitors is used to prevent bribery.

Please do not answer this question with ""we need the entire world to be ancap first because then Canada wouldn't be able to use force on their citizens with a 93% tax rate to invade us"".

Please do not answer the freeloader question with ""once people live in ancap they would then voluntarily donate 93% of their money to the defense firms to protect their liberty"".

I'm simply looking to escape out of my echo-chamber/bubble.

**Context**

Large organizations like Governments perform lots of tasks, 
most of these are dependant on institutional knowledge.

This creates an enormous amount of momentum.

My observation is that distributed organizations that cropped up
online were only effective for a short while, like actions against ACTA etc.
Those were organized on social media platforms like facebook. But that platform has largely been neutralized by the advent of click-farms in Asia as well as algorithms
that optimize for happy-feelings rather than relevance.

The social media political movements have fizzled out, because nobody bothered
to create durable long-lasting connections or a method to preserve
institutional knowledge. 

Hence all the momentum has dispersed. There are more people then ever before that desire for socio-economic change, but all the rage and energy evaporates in rants rather then adding to the momentum of a movement that builds up until it can break through
the barriers put up by those that benefit from the status quo.

**My question** how to have a big organization with institutional knowledge & momentum without the trappings like corruption that accompany centralization & hierarchies.

Why do you want to be a cop?  Do you realize that every person that you initiate force(stop, search, fine, imprison, assault, kill) against for a victimless crime like;

drug possession/use

wrong sticker on their car

expired license

no seatbelt

no permit

failure to pay taxes

failure to pay fines

etc

is actually in truth a crime committed by you.  You are aggressing against that person because that person has harmed no one.  It doesn't matter what the law says, the law was wrong when cops enforced slavery and it's wrong now.  Every time you initiate force against someone who hasn’t harmed anyone, you are the aggressor and the bad member of society, not them.  

All vices contain within them their own punishment; addiction, relationship problems, loss of job, etc.  This is punishment enough.  It is wrong to lock people in cages who have not harmed others.  A person buying a drug from a drug dealer is engaging in a voluntary human interaction, capitalism at work.  If someone wants to sell something and someone wants to buy it-as long as they are not harming anyone else directly-there is no crime.  The drug war is a massive power grab by the state.  It allows them to use asset forfeiture laws to seize billions, protect the fascist pharmaceutical racket, protect the fascist alcohol racket, protect the plastic industrial complex, create a prison industrial complex, create a permanent underclass and a police state.  The drug war is a not a war on drugs, it's a war on people.  You are playing a key role in perpetuating it by aggressing against peaceful people.  If someone on drugs robs a store or kills someone, that person should face the consequences for violating the property rights of others.  However, there is no property right violation and no victim in using, buying, possessing or selling a substance.

Consider all the families you will tear apart.  The children whose fathers and mothers you will put in cages for all manner of victimless crimes.  Imagine the suffering you will cause them, when they ask: “Why won’t they let my mommy or daddy come home?”  It should be you who are forced to look that child in the eyes and tell them why you took their mommy or daddy away.  By destroying families you have recreated in the next generation the cycle of drug abuse and interfamilial violence that broken families create.  How many have you condemned to suffer in terrible government “shelters”?  Shame on you.

It's not your fault because you’re just following orders right?  Wrong, morality applies to you regardless of what uniform you wear.  It is your fault and there is nothing noble or heroic about surrendering your morality and blindly obeying authority.  A life serving the state will eventually eat away at you, you will come to see the pain you have caused others.  It will haunt you.  Much the way veterans who committed crimes in distant lands suffer mentally for their submission to the state and crimes against humanity, invading countries who never attacked them, kicking down doors, killing people, etc.  Unless you are a psychopath/sociopath you will be eaten away inside, your profession has unusually high numbers of them.  

Why not get a real job? Contribute to society.  Right now you’re taking and causing pain and suffering.  Where does your pay check come from?  It comes from taxation.  Taxation is theft.  When you take something that doesn't belong to you by force-whether you have agents do it for you or you do it yourself-it is theft.  

There is a truth called self-ownership.  I own myself, you own yourself.  We don't own other human beings.  I can only control that which I own.  I could only ""tax"" that which I control.  I can't go next door demanding a portion of my neighbors’ income because he is not my property.  A group that claims it has the right to take by force, makeup law and force it on others is a group that is asserting ownership over others.  No one has a higher claim to my life or my body than I do, it doesn't matter what uniform an aggressor wears.  Anyone claiming to own others as property is resting on false authority and is a tyrant.

But what about the social contract?  I never signed any social contract.  A contract that is made with someone before they are able to consent (birth) is an invalid contract by any legal measure.  A valid contract must have a meeting of the minds, the terms must be clearly outlined, understood and agreed upon.  The social contract has none of these qualifications.  It is a myth.

Let me ask you a philosophical question...If you as an individual do not have a right to go next door to your neighbors’ house and demand a portion of his income, how can you delegate that right to a  ""majority""?  How can one delegate a right which he himself does not possess?  It doesn't matter what uniform you wear, stealing is stealing, no “majority” will ever make that which is wrong right.

What is democracy anyway?  It is not even 51% forcing their will on 49%.  Sure the votes may be reported as 51% voted for X, 49% against X, but consider that most people do not even vote.  If more people don’t vote than vote will the state bow its head and dissolve?  It will not, more proof the state is a criminal gang that with illegitimate authority.  If a majority votes to hang a man, does that make it right? What of the man who enforces the will of the “majority” on the minority if the will he is enforcing is morally wrong?  

Ever notice how the state makes up words to hide what it's really doing? For example:

taxation is theft

war is mass murder

collateral damage is murder

asset forfeiture is theft

eminent domain is theft

jails are cages

etc

,they never say what they are truly doing.  This is a sign of brainwashing and propaganda.

People in the market who produce goods and services for the benefit of society are the real heroes.  Men and women who drive semi-trucks across massive distances to bring you goods, the employee who pushes your grocery cart back to the store in freezing weather, the doctor who tries his best to save people, the volunteer who risks his/her health caring for poor people in 3rd world countries, these are real heroes.  Soldiers and police officers are not heroes, they are people who have chosen to blindly follow authority, ignore their conscience and earn a living by parasitically taking from others who are subjected to the illegitimate rule of the state and its’ enforcers.

What good or service do you provide?  You say you provide security or law and order, but what does that mean?  How can those who claim to secure rights do so by violating the property rights of others to earn a paycheck?  How can you say what you do is a service when it's monopolized and everyone is forced to pay for it whether they want your “service” or not?  If Walmart was the only store allowed to provide groceries we would get bad service, high prices and bad products. Competition provides the best products and services.  Why monopolize and prevent competition?

Consider a market based organization.  If they do a bad job, they go out of business.  They receive signals from customers in the form of lost revenue, this tells them they need to change something.  Monopolized state organizations do not receive those signals because their money comes through force, they do not earn it voluntarily from willing customers.  If you want to provide protection and security without extorting people at gunpoint, look into Detroit Threat Management.  It is a free market organization that is so successful at providing security that it protects the poor for free.  DTM have never killed any of their customers.  Governments do not have customers-they only have slaves.  DTM is just one model for how we could provide security in the absence of the state, the market is infinite no one knows what people would engineer to provide security.  In the market, the best idea wins-as opposed to the state's authoritarian top down monopolistic one way of doing things.

Have you considered what you really do?  What do you do with a majority of your time?  You enforce laws; you look for people with the wrong color sticker on their car, people traveling faster than an arbitrary speed limit, people possessing a substance the state deems illegal, people doing business without permission from the gang in charge, etc.  All things with no victim.  It's not your job to ""protect and serve"", the supreme court has ruled on numerous occasions that cops have no duty to protect anyone.  What does it mean to “enforce law”?  Politicians write laws and if you are an enforcer for laws then you are an enforcer for the arbitrary whims of politicians.  You enforce whatever the politicians call ""law"".  That makes you a hired gun for the gang in charge.  Every law is actually a gun pointed at someone.  If I refuse to pay a seatbelt fine they will send a mean letter.  If I ignore that they will send men like you with guns to collect.  If I resist they will cage or kill me.  Every law is nothing more than a gun pointed at everyone (except the elite) and you are the one holding the gun.

One of the key functions police perform for the state is to create a fascist market.  In a market where participants are subject to the rule of a central authority, that central authority will form corrupt relationships with market firms.  They will scratch each others backs.  The government will get goods and services from the firm, the firm will get more regulations from the government which the ill-informed believes are for protecting them but in fact are for preventing competition to the firms favored by the state. The state favors large firms because it makes it easier to impose regulation and makes tax collection easier when there are massive employee payrolls as opposed to many small firms to keep track of.  The result is a few large powerful corporations who play friendly with the state and use state power to dominate everyone else.  Ever notice the revolving door between ex-pharmaceutical CEO/Monsanto CEO and FDA positions of power?  What of the military industrial complex ex-CEO’s gravitating to decision making positions in the military?  Without cops there would be no one to stop someone from competing against monopolistic firms and we would eventually see much smaller companies with much more aggressive competition working harder to provide cheaper, better quality products faster.  Companies like Yelp, Underwriters Laboratories, Urban Spoon and others are already doing a better job keeping customers safe than the state is.  An unintended consequence of your service to the state results in more expensive, poorer quality goods for everyone.

But what would exist without government? Wouldn't people be killing each other, raping and pillaging? On the contrary, that's exactly what the state does with its’ constant law making, regulation, taxation and wars.  To see the worst of society, simply look at government.  If the state disappeared tomorrow there would be a small period of disorder, but over time people would provide services like road building, security, infrastructure, etc.  Why would people do this?  Because they can make a profit doing so.  The free market has every tool we need to run the world, we don't need coercive murderous monopoly gangs.  The profit motive is all we need to have an orderly society.  People acting peacefully can provide everything you think we need a state for.  Besides, 99.99% of peoples’ lives are lived in anarchy.  We don't walk around with cops on our sides at all times.  Cops are few and far between, society functions just fine without them.  Business will go on, life will go on.

The idea that there is a special moral exemption for the state than for individuals is actually a religious belief called statism.  The truth is that morality applies across the board, no matter what uniform you wear.  Religions typically have rituals that assist in brainwashing their followers.  Consider the rituals of the state; 

Pledge of Allegiance (illogical/perverse devotion to cult)

Badges (guise of authority)

Uniforms (guise of authority)

Voting (petitioning the god of the state(prayer))

black robes (guise of authority)

funny hats (guise of authority)

human sacrifice (to die in war for the state)

flags (illogical/perverse devotion to cult)

etc

Statism is a religious belief.  The most dangerous kind because its adherents believe they have legitimate authority to rule over others.  No one has legitimate authority to rule others.

Change your life before it's too late.  Do something to help people. Don't be an enforcer for the politicians.  The future will not look kindly upon cops.  The future is a free future, it may take time but eventually the state will die.  Technologies that decentralize power like Bitcoin and the internet make this inevitable.  You have a chance to be on the right side of history, change now.

I find myself on the anarchistic spectrum of politics, but i am still unclear about where exactly. I have a few questions i would like to have cleared up about anarchocapitalism, because they have been bugging me a bit. Sources are always good, but not needed.


First, who decides what money is good? I know a lot of AnCaps like BitCoin. Is it consensus that BitCoin will be the global valuta in AnCap utopia? What was the generally accepted idea before crypto-currency came along? Will there also be physical money, and if so, who gets to print it?



Secondly, how does an AnCap society deal with orphans? This can be both children whose parents give them away, or perhaps children of single mothers-to-be who die at birth. Are they supposed to just start working as soon as they leave the womb, is it consensus that kids below X years are taken care of by someone, or what?



Thirdly, (and i know i might reveal my lack of research on this one, bear with me) who maintains the non-agression principle? Do you have other options in case of an attack than utilizing your gun, or your hired mercenaries?

(crosspost /r/changemyview)",Conservative,4,1zzwvr,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/1zzwvr/i_believe_that_the_state_is_necessary_but_not/,25,"I posted the following on [/r/changemyview] (https://pay.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1zxsb8/i_believe_that_the_state_is_necessary_but_not/). I would love to hear the anarchist counter-argument.

My views here are heavily based on *Better Angels of Our Nature*, by Steven Pinker, and the ideas of Thomas Hobbes, as presented by Pinker. I have not read Hobbes directly.

**The Hobbesian Trap**

There are four main motives for violence:

1. Predation - You have something I want. I attack you so I can forcibly take it.

2. Preemptive Strike - ""Do unto others before they do unto you."" If I think there is a chance you will attack me for any reason, then I may gain an advantage if I seize the initiative and attack you first. This can apply even if the reason I think you will attack me is because I think that you think that I will attack you. This, as I understand it, is the Hobbesian Trap.

3. Revenge/Retribution - ""Self help justice"" I think you have done something against me, whether it be a physical attack, or an insult. I attack you in retaliation. This is tied to deterrence (4). If I maintain a reputation for retaliation, then you may be hesitant to attack me. Revenge is exacerbated by the fact that everyone thinks they are more ""in the right"" and their enemies are more ""in the wrong"" than they actually are, leading to escalation.

4. Deterrence - ""The best defense is a good offense."" I attack you to establish my reputation and strength. This can be retaliation (3), or pre-emptive strike (2).

**Leviathan**

The solution to the Hobbesian Trap is ""Leviathan"", also known as the state. It can break the Hobbesian Trap in a few ways:

1. Deterrence - By punishing those who act against the best interests of society it makes crime less attractive. It also takes the burden of deterrence off of individuals, which means that their reputation for strength is less important.

2. Breaking the cycle of revenge - By carefully reviewing the details of a case (the judicial process), Leviathan can get an impartial idea of what happened, so that it can give a proportional sentence. Because retribution is coming from a third party, instead of from the individuals in the dispute, there is less incentive to counter-retribution.

3. De-escalation - If I know that you don't have very much incentive to attack me, them I don't have as much incentive toward peremptive strikes, or toward building up my offensive strength.


**Statistics**

According to Steven Pinker, the statistics back up the Hobbesian view of the state and violence. On average, state societies have less war deaths (per capita and as a percentage of all deaths) and a lower homicide rate than stateless societies. (See *Better Angels of Our Nature*, ch. 2 ""The Pacification Process"", esp. fig 2-2, pg. 49; fig 2-3, pg. 53; and 2-4, pg 55.)

**Caveats**

I am aware that states can and have wrought extreme violence, both on their own citizens and on foreigners. Harassment, brutality, false imprisonment, executions, torture, war and genocide have all come out of states.

Police abuse their power. The judiciary convicts innocent people, not always unintentionally. Laws punish people who are aren't hurting anyone.

But, I believe that, even with those things taken into account, society is, on balance, more peaceful with a state than without.

In particular, he discusses the idea here: http://falkvinge.net/2013/09/01/swarmwise-the-tactical-manual-to-changing-the-world-chapter-eight/ under ""CALLS TO ARMS: PERCEPTION IS REALITY""

To paraphrase, the goal is ""controlling the message"" that appears in the media. Basically, come up with a system of rallying people competent to rebut wrong ideas that pop up so that the observing public sees the rebuttals and the right ideas over & over, and also gets the impression that there are more people that believe in the right ideas than the wrong ones.

In essence, an extremely vocal minority takes control of the public dialogue.

The United States is too far gone to save or salvage. We won't have a good country until it fails and we have to start over again.

Right now, I'm as close as I can possibly be to being an anarcho-capitalist without being one (extreme minarchy), but there are two things that hold me back:  

1) Property rights - Government is sort of an arbitrator between all of us, in that it defines who owns what. I've heard a lot of people explaining how this functions in an anarcho-capitalist society, but I'm just not thoroughly convinced.  

2) Justice system - I know the government isn't very good at this, but I'm not sure how anarcho-capitalism would make it better? It seems to me that this would affect the poorest of society the worst, as if you couldn't afford justice protection, your death or murder would go unseen or uncared.

The state as cheapest property protection,Conservative,6,1g2knb,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/1g2knb/the_state_as_cheapest_property_protection/,5,"I think all anarchists agree that the modern state serves to protect the upper class and wealth stratification. My understanding of anarcho-capitalist theory is that if the state is abolished, the privilege current capitalist enterprises (corporations, etc) have will also be dissolved. I agree with this, but I'm unsure about why capitalists would want that, and why capitalists in an anarchist society would keep society stateless. 

I've often heard that in anarcho-capitalist society private property will be protected by private security forces. This makes me queasy because why wouldn't capitalists just support the formation of a state and have their workers pay for the protection of private property through taxes?

Like Proudon talks about in Property is Theft,  it is the working class that pays for the protection of capitalists' property. It is unjust because capitalists don't pay an appropriate amount of money for their proportion of protection they receive from the state. While i think we can all agree that this is unjust, that does not mean people will not support it or that such a system will not come into being.

To me, the state, funded by working class taxes, is an ideal way for the capitalists to protect their property, whereas in an anarcho-capitalist society, capitalists would actually have to pay for their property's protection and incur the costs. So, the idea of the state not reconstituting itself in an ancap society makes me skeptical because there is financial incentive for capitalists to just agree to form a state over the entirety of society because then they skip out on a large majority of the cost of defense, shifting the costs onto lesser/non-property owners and keeping the wealth they would have spent on protection to themselves. This is mostly worrisome because this motive is rooted in the mechanics of market competition that capitalists support.

TL;DR If there is financial incentive for capitalists to support the formation of a state by shifting the costs of property protection onto working class taxpayers, why wouldn't they do it an an anarcho-capitalist society?   ",1370898337.0

What's stopping private legal systems from judging in their customers favour all the time? If they profit from prison labour...,Conservative,7,1arf5d,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/1arf5d/whats_stopping_private_legal_systems_from_judging/,31,"Hi, I'm a minarchist, who is for a volentaryist quasi-state. Former an-cap and I've some questions relating to my misgivings on privatised legal systems. So where am I wrong, in your opinion? Also I'm slightly dyslexic, apologies.

The system of the plaintiffs choice could entail any punishment, for the most minor of infractions... Would companies that made use of prison labour, not profit most from life sentences, for the most minor of crimes? Could they not pay the courts for prisoners or even run the courts themselves? Would this not create a massive incentive for false imprisonment and lengthy sentences for the most minor of infractions? Also false accusations to such systems to win compensation.

What are the prisoners rights? If the private legal system determines it, it could be anything, even nothing. It's deliberately crazy but imagine if prisoners were sold as a sex slaves? Why does the accuser have to use a system? Cant he tie the accused up in his basement, who's stopping him? If people are... What extra right is it that private legal systems have to judge and detain people that he doesn't?

I mean I do like aspects of Robert Murphy's suggestions on prisons in a free society, I think there may be a place for things like he suggests. But really struggle with the idea of unlimited choice in law. Defence is justified but beyond that when the assailant is detained it's not longer defence.  To me it aught be the pursuit of justice, but with choice it's whatever the accuser and court wants to get out of it, namely a guilty verdict and profit... Aside from that revenge, financial gain, sadistic pleasure anything.

We have law and order and due process, innocent until proven guilty, not to protect the guilty but to *try* to protect the innocent. When choice enters the equation what prevents the accuser from subjecting the accused, to a system who's trail they are incapable of winning...

Allow me to explain: in any economy, capitalist, redistributed, or otherwise, there are incentives to create value profitably for goods and services. This necessarily means that producers of these will seek the most optimum margins for profit of these goods and services: this is exactly the right thing to do, but it leads, seemingly inevitably, to the incentive of expedience as a way to facilitate this, which is a very good thing until that expedience causes those goods and services to become dangerous.

Take a light switch, for example.  There are standards and regulations that describe how much current they should be capable of withstanding, the materials they should be constructed of, the way they should be installed, the physical aesthetics they should adhere to, and so on.  Without these standards, light switches- or any commodity item- will be subject to competition switches built to unspecified standards, using materials that may or may not put the function of the switch or the safety of the users at risk, chosen to produce that switch at lower cost, with lower cost to the consumer.

This, in itself, is a problem, but not a big one.  The big problem with this is the consequences: cheap parts, subject to dangerous usage, will inevitably lead to damage, or if you want to keep track of this, the loss of items or functionality of financial value (including human life, which has value that can be measured using money to assess that value).  

And so the situation occurs when losses are caused by people making decisions that were expediently beneficial, and now the problem should become clear: how is that lost value repaid, and how is a person without enough value to be held to account when they can't repay the damages they have caused?  If life were simple, it would be their own loss: use a shitty switch, your own house burns down, and you die in a fire.  But life has put most of the world close together- in apartments, joined homes, or in buildings very near each other, and damage is inevitable.  Who must be held to account for it, how, and who is actually to blame?

If I install my own light switch in my apartment that causes a fire that kills everybody and destroys the building, is it my fault for buying a switch that was unsafe, whether I knew it or not? is it the land lord's, for not installing a safer switch? is it the fault of the manufacturer for not producing a safer switch? is it the fault of the other residents, for living with a neighbor as dumb as me? What if I had no choice- if I'm poor and can only afford the cheapest switch, am I more to blame for not capitalizing on opportunities as well as others? if there is only one switch available, is it the retailer's fault for not stocking others? is it the fault of manufacturers who could have produced safer switches to compete with this one, but didn't? Is it everybody's fault- but if so, what portion of blame does anybody share? Even if everything is insured, is the loss less tangible because it has been transferred to an agency that seeks to capitalize on presumed risk of loss, and which has incentives to not recognize and cover the loss- perhaps by blaming me for installing a switch which was not covered under the insurance plan?


The second problem is intellectual investment.  In a broad sense, this covers both research and development and intellectual property.  I won't stand up and defend the patent system as it is here, because it has many problems, but it is a means of captalizing that, since it is regulated, is also a means of exchange (briefly: if I design a helicopter and patent it, but have no capability or interest in producing it, patents let me captitalize on this anyway by selling the rights to the idea, even though I'm just a person, and the buyer would likely be a large company or syndicate that I would be unable to compete with on equal terms otherwise).

So: creativity, research, design, invention, iteration on designs or solutions, and discovery all have monetary value, all are the result of investment by the people accomplishing these tasks, and the inability of these people to compete with established players in a market can be considered an opportunity cost that is exactly equal to the value their work alone increases in the market that they do not benefit from financially, despite any attempts to do so.

There are at least two possible situations directly following, and a further lost opportunity from the (also seemingly inevitable) result of keeping the fruits of this labor secret.

First, there is the case where the secret is eventually successfully implemented by a competitor, which relies on investment by the competitor in independent research and attempts, as well as other costs such as reverse engineering, and is further complicated because the time this takes may or may not give the secret's original discoverer time to capitalize on it and be able to compete in an existing marketplace: an example is the telescoped locking head lug mechanism in bolt action rifles, which a german inventor developed and was able to capitalize on, but which was eventually implemented elsewhere independently; there are plenty of other examples here, and all induce risk that can be mitigated with some form of regulation, even de-facto consensus.

The second case is that the secret can never be replicated, and dies with the creator or discoverer; in this case, the entire human species experiences a tangible financial loss in the form of decreased operating capacity.

Finally,the lost opportunity is for iterations on development as a result of secrecy: imagine if petrol engines were a secret, kept in locked boxes, only opened by their inventor; we would not have diesel engines, or rotary engines, or any of the other things inspired by the design- or as a best case scenario, we would have the opportunity cost of the time it took for those other things to be independently derived.

So, these are the apparent achilles heel in anarcho-capitalism; it results in unnecessary debt or opportunity cost as a direct result of attempts to capitalize.  This doesn't mean that the entire idea must be scrapped: it means that these issues must be addressed meaningfully, honestly acknowledged, and solutions found for them.",1354254495.0

Arguments such as ""But it'll never happen in an ancap society"" are unfounded. I don't trust my fellow human enough. 

Also, on a more fundamental level, I believe over time, power naturally concentrates into a single or small group of entities. Like some sort of rule of nature, over time it always happens, such that having no states will result in the likes of pre-state warfare. Technologically advanced tribes, who do not agree with your philosophy, and don't care for it, will see the void and attempt to fulfill it.

In theory your philosophy almost makes sense. It's downfall is that humans will not respect your philosophy, and will operate under their own philosophies, whilst recognizing very low power centers throughout society, the humans will look to concentrate it for their own self interests.",1351214533.0
